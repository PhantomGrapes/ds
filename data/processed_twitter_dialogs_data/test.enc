ummm dads also gave you a big old inheritance cupcake. steve jobs built a company.
trump is not answering the question. riffing.
okay everybody it’s debate night and you’re ill-advisedly on social media. stay safe out there.
he clearly didn't do enough coke prior. he's super low energy, and highly sniffy.
haha. so cool that you got to go! did you get a playing card?
yo how many lines you think he railed before the debate? listen to that sniffle
trump sounds like he has a cold.
donald trump keeps sniffing through his nose. i know a coke addict when i see one. chill aht

trump has no respect and he is losing this debate already.

excited &amp; nervous at the same time to watch this debate 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
a habitual liar and a reality star...
this is fucking unreal
great minds
hillary is managing his interruptions brilliantly. trump looks like a thwarted five-year-old trying to get mommy's attention.
he's really fucking retarded now i understand why his supporters support him
i love when hil shits on the wealthy like okay hunny how much was that outfit. just own it boo boo
trump has the sniffles. that is why he did not have time to prepare. needs a kleenex.
okay now bully trump is has emerged. so rude.
"donald thinks climate change is a hoax. i believe it's real." —
what is up with this interrupting ?!?!
is still there?
also, after all the conspiracies about clinton's health, trump has a cold? 2016 is kinda on a roll.
he’s so fucking patronizing &amp; condescending it’s disgusting
can the moderator keep him from over talking her...like aren't they supposed to take turns?
donald trump really should smile more. he's coming off as very unlikeable.
looking forward to tonight's debate knowing that millions of americans will see the i've known for over 40 years.

they say 100m people are watching these . if you’re interested enough to watch, i hope you’re interested enough to vote. we need you
he is though, in business he's a smart man

that's exactly why i'm not going to open my twitter app for the rest of the debate 😂
right?! i'm cringing every 5 seconds 🙂
trump seems to think he is the moderator.
i'm laughing out loud.
lmao i hate you sis .. i really do. i'll consider it they both ain't shit
holt in danger of losing control
what i know 100% is in every debate i have judged where an opponent yells they are lying and desperate. guess who's yelling? trump

she is focused.
i truly hate him
i guess there are no rules are interrupting? trump is just jabbing every 30 seconds -- it's unwatchable/insane.

"that makes me smart" wow.

and there is the problem in a nutshell - who says she's fighting to win?
oh hillary hillary hillary ...what are you hiding in those 30,000 plus emails you deleted though. 🤔
competitive yang hashtag mo ha. char. but i agree. pep is basically trash content..
we're wasting 10 minutes of a 90 minute debate on something no one but the media cares about: trump's tax returns. no moderators!!!
i hate how she can get away with interjections
a significant silver lining of the trump candidacy could be the resurgence of the term "jackanape."
he thinks that's what makes him popular with everyone and it does with the crazies for sure.
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:

i'm scared about the future of this country...
...and then i quit recommending your app to educators anywhere.
so is that a no to the financial records mr. trump. wtf?! he sounds like a car salesman.
naw it's a good thing.
then why did they vote for goldwater, the racists' candidate in 1964? you rly know nothing.
"it's about time this country had someone that knew you a little about money.." how many times have you claimed bankruptcy?
home care workers next to me discussing how much they get hit w taxes on low wages, not happy w trump's tax answers.
yes simultaneously
people (especially millennials) need to register to vote so that this doesn't happen again.

no, probably just a lot of traffic. try again :(

what is hillary's worst lie? vote now!
real talk: has anyone noticed that he has terrible hair?
did he just say that he maybe did not pay someone because they did a bad job?
trump just rooted for the housing collapsed. ..that's business. what an azzh***
hey , do any of you think trump is remotely winning this!?!
it would be funnier if the very real possibility of him in the white house wasn't so damn terrifying.
i don't know why i thought this might be a discourse on issues. whatever your party, this is embarrassing. america, i weep

why is trump no longer sniffling????????? what's going on?
never ! it smells like auntie anne's and toilet water
oooh - missed charlotte! t hanks!
law &amp; order???? he doesnt follow the laws he said so
has anyone seen donald trump and william shatner in the same room...
it's pretty standard practice during a debate to make and take notes, so that you can address points.
"secretary clinton doesn't want to use two important words: law and order." notes fraternal order of police endorsement. -
er... there's probably a "presidential suite"? maybe? eh?
from now on, i'll use these in budget testimony. the epf is tremendous and unbelievable.
hillary clinton deleted her emails as part of standard security protocol.
i see melting. she needs to sit
oh shit that means he's more qualified to run the country
when you get spam comments on your instagram, do you a. ignore them, b. delete them, or c. report them?
read her profile
okay can you not say that about our communities, though. it's not cool. "you walk down the street you get shot" shut up.
popcorn? i think scotch would be better!
idk man im not gonna get serious over a deleted tweet. god forbid i tweeted something and then deleted it!
he was a very against-police judge.
it went against a very against police judge, guys
unarmed black men getting shot is not because of law and order donald
great shoutout from on law and order!
you know where you can watch law &amp; order? at the fabulous trump international hotel.
but what did you order?
soak in warm water with epsom salt :^)
did just compare us to a third world country?!
this will be my starter squad boys !! what do you guys think ?
the essential question here is, will anyone care that 45 min in, trump has articulated not one policy to do the things he promises?
trump is literally peter griffin.
i said she had to win big. she won bigly.
i can't believe trump is promoting stop-and-frisk in a debate. hillary, if you don't eat him for this, i will be disappointed…
but its the pro-vaxxers, you know, we * that are rude, not the calm &amp; decorous vaccine-questioning**
stop and frisk these nuttttssss -lester holt, moderator
i hate how drew brees wears aggressive eye black inside the dome, such a try hard move
finally starting . let's do this! eighties style.
.: "stop and frisk was found to be un-constitutional."
liam is on my lap and we feel the same way about this.
oh it's all only about where he owns property!
is it just me or are they starting to look the same?
stop 👏 talking 👏 about 👏 chicago 👏 like 👏 you 👏 know 👏 anything 👏
i fear that trump supporters are eating this up, even though he sounds like an angry, unhinged, blowhard.
her answer is mediocre at best. not surprising. a condemnation of private prisons would be too much to ask.
trump loves debt for his businesses! where are his taxes?
look at the fucking nowcasts, man.
but is hrc landing? status quo is 2016 voter kryptonite.
just out of curiosity, has trump _actually answered_ a question asked of him yet?
i think he's talking about that movie with leonardo dicaprio
didn't sign up for all these groans.
what am i saying he wants to throw hispanics over a wall.. where am i supposed to buy top man clothes in chile?!
rt : i don’t know if it’s a world record but trump has been sued more than 3,500 times over the past 30yrs.
but pulling the positives. this debate is showing everyone that trump really is a fucking idiot. (if we didn't already know that)
his condescending interjections and interruptions and mansplaining are hitting the deepest part of my womanly frustration
can we have some factchecking?! stop and frisk did not reduce crime. no one is going to your website, hillary, say it now! you too lester!
hillarys insane policies have killed thousands.
hillary, for fuck's sake, he just said the country's fucked because of the iraq war - a republican endeavor! bush's war, not yours!
i think my feed is broken. this man can not be saying these words. he can not be saying these words!
average temp ain't drop in the last 100 years, how am i a fool?
it's like saying the sky is blue
i'm convinced the sniffling is a nervous tic.
not for nothing, the clintons are a big reason why the criminal justice system is the way it is right now
for you. you're already on her side.
really into how frequently the candidates are talking about law and order. excellent tv show that deserves national recognition.
i actually feel sorry for her, **** doesn't want to marry or date anyone 😔
answer the question !!!! do you or do you not think there is implicit bias against black people
yes, mandatory sentences should be reduced and private prisons should be ended, both of which grew under bill clinton.
back home in nyc
and then want black folk to vote for him because "what else do we have to loose?" smdh
that tweet is deleted
do you a think a tie (or a wash, or a non-swallows-all news-sound bite) goes to him?
please do us all a favor and end your ridiculous campaign !!!
study after study proves that stop and frisk is not only unconstitutional, it was not effective. it causes more problems than it helped.
just wait till the end of the year😂
watching the debates and they're just yelling at each other. this is great.
that's my best friend ❣️
the room i'm in agrees that trump is getting progressively more orange as this goes on
trump is exactly right- the fbi stats are going to show violent crime is increasing again after a 30 year decline.
gavels are not used in law courts, only in the films.
hello and thank you for asking. no i'm not broadcasting anywhere. i would like to be but they don't seem to want my services.

you are like a broken record with this "mre" obsession.
ugh. i know. i want it to happen so badly though
me watching rn
"trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. you know what else i prepared for? being president."
why can't stay on topic? use your words!

"{blacks love me}" the balls on this guy
"i'm kind of glad to be canadian right now." - my friend who's watching the debate with me
"just listen to what you heard." drop the mic, senator clinton.
hillary is basically saying that all americans are "implicitly racist." that's offensive and is going to hurt her.
trump needing to find out about 's birth certificate because he needed to defeat isis is the answer to an lsat question.
trump needs to stahp! he is calling others "new politicians" ... he is the newest politician. period. wow.
//i have had two today xd
why they unfollow you
this tweet was not deleted, here's the link

iwannawatchthedebate!!!!! dammit. too late and far too busy. good luck america.x
tbh i do not have a favorite candidate. haven't really been wowed by anyone
his constant sniffling is giving me anxiety 😖
clinton: has prepared for debate, and has also "prepared for the presidency," to big laughs here.
okay but what if the sponge has an auburn logo on it
hillary worked for obama for 5 years. that says more about what was said in a campaign.
trump is this close to telling hillary she's acting like her shit doesn't stink.
when a man is sued for discriminating against black tenants &amp; pushes birtherism, he's giving you an idea of what kind of president he'd be.
"i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt." regarding a lawsuit revolving around racism. glad you didn't admit it.
incredibly ineloquent
what's everyone eating/drinking/dancing to this evening?
this debate
just got out of lab. who's winning?
he's bragging about opening a club that doesn't discriminate? does he want credit for not lynching people?
is this whole campaign a way to publicize the new penn ave hotel?
rnt u there rn
just like a conservative pussy. can't take the heat hahahahaha! ;)
just finished my public space opus dropping wednesday. who's winning the debate?
they are getting older brother cant get too heavy, need exlax
yeah that was a great top of the 9th!
wait, can't we talk about mar-a-lago more?
is it just me or does look constipated? do you think he's sick?
are people really saying that trump was strong on trade? he seemed incoherent and ranting to me?
rhode island seems like a huge state sponsor of hacking
hillary clinton's campaign just sent out a message blasting stop and frisk that quoted , and .
trump could shoot someone on camera and then turn around and say it wasn't him. and his supporters would believe him.
today on may have told us how this would go down. she clued us in to which clinton would show up.
all sound bytes. no plan.
you are winning, mrs. president
when donald trump goes low, we go high.
white kid with glasses who looks like he's in middle school right? lol
somebody get donald trump to blow his nose. he sounds like he's got a nasty coke habit.
looks a little parched
"racism...boy i don't know..."
of course my swim practice schedule conflicts with everything i do
this is not looking good. trump is holding it together. hillary feels hesitant
one of the two candidates for the most powerful job on earth can barely complete a coherent sentence. how did we get here?
trump said ice -- a federal agency -- endorsed him.
so down wagers sometime?
"i was just endorsed by isis" ????
this is non-linear logic. i'm not understanding the connections between the birther debate and combating isis
omg. the things i would do for that man.
honestly, unemployment is 5%. why are we talking about jobs?
“as far as the cyber…”
barron trump is gonna solve the cyber!
really useful contrast in real-time
they made a fantastic endorsement.
keeps raising taxes. its f*ckin ugly out here
sounds relaxing to be honest.
"stop harvesting putin's pubes to make your combover." -my wife
did trump just say he was endorsed by isis? oh no, he said ice…
is trying to say that someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds is or .... . goodness
there donald goes dissing overweight people. he can't help himself.
"someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds." and with that, trump called down eternal cyber rage on himself.
here's the 400 pound hacker
maybe it was russia. maybe it was china! maybe it was the first years in slytherin!
did he just suggest his ten-year-old son manage our country's cybersecurity?
cyberimmigrant attacks
aaaaaand he's resorted to fat shaming
blue background - no way she'd want to blend in!
oh, stop.... it's totally cool to put americas secrets at risk, too! neat.
not sure about that one but wouldn't be surprised if she did
that cyber line was the quote of the night
trump is acting like he can defeat isis as if drillary clinton didn't pop qaddafi and osama
donald trump claims black and hispanic people are ‘living in hell’ …
.... 400 pound bed?
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
who is winning the debate so far?
trump's son is a hacker?
both candidates are equally clueless when it comes to "cyber".
yeah but i want a notre dame player on every nfl team which no other school can say they have
in case you thought trump couldn’t be more nonsensical in how he doesn’t answer a question, i give you “the cyber”!
nothing worse than people dumping their political views onto twitter
what's wrong to tuff for a woman?
trump is looking worked up and angry and sulky and shouty -she looks utterly in control by contrast.
not a fan of yours anymore. 👎👎👎👎👎 can't believe you can support him.
whatcha wearing there, stud?

hi🙋brooklyn! good week to all!
it doesn't matter how she looks sexist (but i agree, she does look great)
you're a hater and you talked bad about me to someone else on snap and u got caught.
dear hillary, raising taxes is a sure debate winner. not!
your reminder that all of this time is being spent discussing a danger that poses less of a threat to americans than lightning does
he should blow his nose. he’s already blown the debate.
thinking if we sent graduate students over to plunder oil that could be a game changer for us
i'm sorry. what?
hahah this gets better and better! "i have a son. he's great with computers" 😂😂😂 this is comedy gold!!!
we’ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system and end private prisons.
i mean, i don't love when he talks ever. but those times are less bad
happy birthday!! 💗🎉
ofcourse my g
i thought he was a racist and that's why i looked for someone that wasn't to vote for. not the other way around…

who needs a tv when they can just read your tweets full of quotes...
ok, you will not forget this emails thing. so trump should be the president? the emails are a big deal than he's craziness?
and its baile season😍😍😍
we're good brothers
you have a better temper than hillary. are you serious?
also lol that are watching the debate together but tweeting about it and not talking 😂
i shouldn't be watching this alone
this might be the biggest instance of can't i've ever evened.
everyone please google if trump supported the war in iraq
if you had howard stern's name being mentioned during the debate in the office pool, congratulations.
what about mrs. hannity?
he nice i'm just saying he sound gay af in the video 😭
live fact-check: trump is misleads about the origin of isis, which started before clinton was secretary of state.
trump says being president is like "the scene in e.t. where the boy has to choke a dog to death". that scene is not in e.t.
donald trump says he likes black people and then treats debate moderator lester holt like shit.
can you have a winning temperament? calm, nasty, those are temperaments. sry but leading the free world is not just about winning!

lester holt seems to be cross-examining trump, but not doing the same with hillary...
i'm just watching it's always sunny because i have to.
i don't often agree with but he's right: trump is a "fraud" and a "phony."
y'all say people who vote trump are racist/ignorant. but i'm puerto rican lol i'm a latino which makes me a minority to.
hillary is laughing and i feel like she's laughing at all of us in a weird condescending way
i will stand with police and protect all americans!
if i had another nickle for every time he said "it's very important", i could just buy all of the us &amp; declare myself dictator...dicatoress?
stream of conscious word spew. whereas hillary sounds prepared, well-researched and articulate.
why does let him just ramble on? where's the clock lester?
hahaha i love how we're communicating via twitter even though we're sitting next to each other.
why isn't hillary clinton 50 points ahead?

un freaking believable.

trump started the evening calling hrc "secretary clinton." he has now demoted her to "hillary."

you underestimate the depths of people's depravity &amp; stupidity. his supporters still believe he won this mess.
omg yes the ban man!!! he is so great!!!! a dream come true 😖
he's probably pretty good in a boardroom though. of assholes.
why can't we have a presidential debate moderated well. lester holt is not controlling this.
seeing billcallahan for the 1st time instead of watching of the debate was already a great idea, then he covered easy wind!
"i have a much better temperament than [clinton] has... my strongest asset." -
wow. that was sad, ugly.
trump called a beauty contestant ms. piggy and ms. housekeeping. he did not apologize. that's mildly concerning.
"it's not nice!" trump talks like he's six years old.
exactly sir your facts are you're personal observations which are false. fact.

hillary brought up michelle obama's dnc speech that donald trump's wife plagiarized lmfaoooooooooooooo pettyyyyy

my head literally hurts listening to this idiot talk.
those are our only two choices.
lester headed straight to the bar 🍺🍺🍺
trump saying hrc doesn't have stamina to be potus. she's certainly showing the vigor &amp; stamina to take it to him in this debate.
guys, be nice to trump.
donald trump is more concerned with pandering to the gun lobby than keeping families safe.
hope trump and hillary are going to mcheebs for bladder buster after the
like i said you're not worth my time.
not sure which is more grody.
wow. no words. how is this even real?
💆🙅🙆🙇stretching out.. that was fun.. hillary clearly won.. but i'm sure pundants will have fun with this.. everyone good night. ✌️
donald trump had the opportunity to crucify her as to the email controversy, to explain it once and for all. and he blew it.
text from a gop friend of mine in congress. i'm sorry, congressman, but tonight hillary is coming across as presid…
prove it. all former presidents get secret service protection for themselves and family.
he's donald trump. what'd you expect?
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
the only thing "super" about trump in the last half hour is superficial. and now they are like boxers with seconds to go!
daaang, trump was not gonna shake his hand. but clinton was like 'wassap?!' hand shake!
now that the debate is over who might you vote for?
trump and hilary should just throw hands back stage and call it a day
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
hillary clinton: donald trump supported the invasion of iraq. trump: "wrong... wrong... wrong"
i am a woman who will never vote for hillary clinton. she doesn't represent me.
one of our best presidents literally had polio i gtg
can someone send me some trap beats to .com 🌚
the moment you finally get into bed for a good night sleep and your tv changes channels to
trump slayed hillary with "experience, but very bad experience" and she instantly jumped to the sexist card. hype
not inherently, those topics are sure to be covered at the next debate. plus this debate made him look really really really bad.
who's down to do this with me tonight?
why is that idiot's inbred family on the debate stage?
can we get some balloons to fall while bill is on stage? bill loves balloons 🎈🎈🎈🎈
and racist don't forget racist.
tonight's debate confirmed this year's election is like picking the best browns quarterback for your fantasy team.
nbc's consistently interrupted trump, but not hillary.
trump on birther issue: 'i think i did a good job'
i think my fave part of tn was hillary calling trump out for being shady when he'd just called her out for being shady not 30 sec. before :)
or emails, or the clinton foundation. she controlled the entire debate and he scrambled.
thank you tribe!!!!!! the pounding sound you hear is not my drum. it is my heart beating. go tribe.
in the spirit of "fuck everything," i'm ignoring the tv and alla y'all right now and eating a giant luscious ball of burrata.
trump getting crushed by analysts but not sure it was the knockout suggested. clinton being called too nice. all style comments being made
now, i presume, each candidate will retreat to their quarters and write 50,000 words to defend these positions?
final share of twitter conversation: 38% - 62% -
cue "why can't we be friends"
not sure mate but the system in the us seems to be in real trouble
trump supporter in the audience, as trump answers stamina question: “this is painful.”
the most surreal thing is that trump seems to think that people don't have access to the internet where his lies are easily disproven.
this is the dumbest thing you ever tweeted. the regressive left truly is a cancer.
tonight, jynx got a new moniker: pablo frisk-o-bar. because all cats get like, 200 names.
this debate reminds me of the debate leslie knope had with bobby newport in parks and rec
yes. followed by some
so, obviously enough clinton crushed that and trump was awful. but i can't see it changing many minds, can you?
so inspirational
if i had a bill for every stupid thing donald trump said i think i would have more then a small loan of a million dollars
reading tweets out loud to my wife
hillary's right, white people do get away with more crimes than black people. she murdered 4 people and she's still not in jail 😕
add your name now to join the millions of americans who are with hillary all the way to the white house!
he is a joke but is a tragedy. take your pick, america!
my right-wing live stream has completely given up on showing hillary. it's only showing trump.
i'm australian so i have no idea about anything bebides a debate xd
(i think david brooks is ridiculous sometimes but i secretly like him.)
trump is every person that tries to commission an artist for the exposure.
this is the definition of stop and frisk, found unconstitutional.
for the record i am no rosie fan but fuck him and lena dunham, and my apologies to larry david for almost referring to her as "ld"
basically were fucked🙏
this is my night:
lmaooo ignorant rich white men been running around the world wrecking the buffet for centuries in the name of civilization and success
every time the lines of text behind clinton and trump don't line up i want to scream
he was super curt with as well.....
plenty of undecideds are looking for revelations on "trust" and "character" in the debates. what a bad place to go looking...
lol sometimes celente is off the reservation for me but occasionally find him insightful
no one can leave this debate thinking trump is a stronger candidate than clinton. no one…
so, you're saying you're a grandmother?
how can i get this sticker
trump was ultimately the winner tonight! he did a phenomenal job, for a non politician and his first one on one presidential debate!
oh man should i bring buttons to hand out when i come!? 😂
that's why you gotta replace them too
why are reporters asking trump to repeat his answers from the debate?
i don't think trump is aided by prolonged birther debating. omarosa had the right idea.
p sure he can only speak in hyperbole
everyone is telling me to watch 'rick and morty.' i'll give it a try, friends.
awww i'm so proud of got7 and how popular they've gotten 😊 good for them 😊❤️
anyone watching the spin room right now?
watch the presidential debate tonight in the great outdoors at la plaza cultural
. says trump's mention of new hotel on pennsylvania avenue drew gasps in the spin room
beyoncé is wearing a new costume for "daddy lessons"!
trump supporters will think he won and clinton supporters will think she won. that isn't baffling. imo...it was pretty even.
srsly - all of the things 'executed' as part of the executive are paid for by taxes
yes, you caught that one too! trump: the 400 pounder using internet from home and hacking!
im still trying to figure out how we went from talking about nukes to rosie odonnell.
to see the mvb news just after watching that debate...that's a double-shot of suck.

the entire was the moderator attacking . unbelievable.
omg but the requires work and spending your own free time to learn something 😱 who would wanna do that?! 😱
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
it's never too late,
i wasn't watching, did she make him actually drop dead on the stage of an apoplexy? if not, that counts as a failure in my book.
"you need stamina," says man who has sighed, scowled, grown impatient and angrily interrupted under pressure of 90 minutes of debating
thanks for the reply :) . still trying to understand the whole mansplaining thing.

nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
i disagree, all attention can be re-directed towards good if used properly
i think independents and third party types may be more inclined toward hillary. can't imagine she would blow it next time.
trump: we don't have the money (to do what we need to) because it's been squandered on all of your bad ideas. another point for trump.
who told hillary clinton to keep smiling like she’s at her granddaughter’s birthday party?
ok livetweeting over!! everyone calculate your retweets during the debate and divide by 90. if your retweets per minute &lt; 1.0 you did bad.
haven't you been wondering that for a year and a half.

that's awfully peculiar. most of the debate polls are showing a 10-percent-plus victory for trump.
all the men, all the times.
if hes already doing that though… does he have any faith in winning? if not hes letting you all down right now…
did u watch the debate? did u miss the part where he thinks global warming is a hoax? thought u loved the earth? super confused
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
that number gonna get the most play since (281) 330-8004...
that's a wrap! let me know what you think! who won and why? i'll retweet...
your poll is literally as over exaggerated as everything that came out of trump's mouth tonight. literally.
wait, sid was sending mcclatchy reporters to foreign continents? that guy's got juice

clinton won this debate in part because she had more stamina for this than trump. he flagged badly after 30 minutes. she didn't.
👄must shred hillary to pieces next debate&gt;no defending, no holding bk, no mentioning stuff they will twist&gt;focus
and that equates to 94% how?
split is probably gonna piss off a lot of people, btw, when it comes to mental health stuff.
she was a lil too confident for me and i was super awkward and it was a mess lol
"how'd it go?" "i didn't bring up her husband's infidelity." *kellyanne gives him a liver treat* "good boy!"
lester holt never asked about clinton foundation or benghazi. he only interrupted trump, not hillary. shame on lester!
maybe nfl rules in spanish will help. cuatro downs to get diez yards. does that help?
megyn cooing to clinton campaign manager. picture getting clearer by the minute.
i asked trump if he was tempted to bring up bill clinton's sex scandals.
my thoughts exactly! disappointing.
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
and if you find them both deplorable?
sorry for the delayed response, matt. we do hope you got upgraded today. if not, we hope you enjoyed the flight! ^chris
😂😂 damn it!!! i remember us gossiping about them! you popped all up in my head!!!!
hillary is a gem. you can polish a gem. don the con is a turd and u can't polish a turd.
that was terrible, and destroyed more of my faith in humans than the last two months of election combined. time for netflix &amp; snacks.
hillary pretty much made case for continuous monitoring of citizens in a subtle way that most people probably didn't catch.
let's have a debate party oct 9 aka us watching it and live tweeting.

i’m so numb to iphone that i ordered mine two weeks ago and i’m not really that hyped about it any more.
i've probably watched dee's homer at least 5 times, and i still can't believe it
half joking/half not: wonder if the debate causes fb to put in a bid for twitter. one network shined, the other is a ghost town.
we may have tweeted this at the same time 😂
hillary's out here giving the game plan to beat isis and todd bowles won't even tell us who the third guard is at practice.
trump surrogates in spin room also criticizing holt's moderation and focus, which is always telling.
sure, why worry about preparing for all of them? there's 17 of them again, right?
hillary and trump arguing how they'll punch iran. yay!! improvement over last election where candidates argued how they'll punch pakistan.
until you roll over and roll right into the pile of crumbs. that's kinda when you know you've hit an all time low.
i think hillary should have said "say it donald!" when trump said he was stifling himself. could've drawn out the self-immolation.
it's too early. it's too fucking early for this
come to glens falls and wallingford

did hillary clinton motivate millennials, black and latino/a voters, and disaffected sanders supporters in tonight's debate?

not sure if you watch it, but that grey's anatomy episode he directed was just magnificent. took the series to another level.
every time i put on pants i worry: "is today the day i got too fat again to put on these pants?"
with you on that, and 150%!! everytime a word comes out of his mouth, he has no facts to back it up.
