no he still blamed for starting it but he finished it &amp; repeated twice. all bs!
obama is our enemy 😠

you have to come to boybingo and boy auction w us
probably overly sensitive liberals
impressive.... well you know the rest.
so 84 is on ir to start the season - opens door for 13 or 10 to make the team. no vet d man for depth?

have you been binge watching the maury povich show? "you are not the father" 😂😉
trying to be overly subtle. my mistake. sorry.
i secretly love planetariums and go by myself all the time so this was right up my alley.
you can't make this stuff up!
but the staffers in question weren't remotely the first to use xenophobic rhetoric against obama, so no "genesis" there.
glad trump could throw in a compliment to sean hannity "who is a great guy by the way." maria kind of reminds me of sean.
yea &amp; i think oct 6 for act iii, not 100% sure.
saw oyf last night but missed u backstage! 😢 u were wonderful as always! &amp; the show is still awesome. hope 2 c u next time!

the media knew that the event was being held at his new hotel so why is everyone scratching their heads. same as scotland! no?
great. then he should remain a (lousy, bankrupt) businessman. not presidential. and how 'bout those taxes? what's in em?? hmmm.....
that is my point. i don't trust he won't move them to vegas. and i'm okay with it. not juiced. just ok.

when was his last real interview? he's really focusing on fox news &amp; useless cretins like jimmy fallon &amp; matt lauer.
they are, but now we see ml becoming a platform for ai...
yes he is more of a scorer than passer, he has averaged over 10 pts his whole career
one example of the larger complaint about nprs (mis)handling of trump. i trust youre aware, even if you disagree.
oh okay that's still good tho
looks pretty awesome guys! #🇺🇸
what a great speech in fairfax were you there?
i love it! like everything's further &amp;there's always a commute involved but i've gotten used to it. i love this city so much!
just because he is evil doesn't make you paragon of virtue. it's not one or the other, both of you suck.

you are a bad person why do you have opinions
i didn't buy it for 1 second, this is called "projecting" trump calling hrc a bigot is a good example.
vote siphons working for won't get debate stage exposure. too too bad.
more like gibby taking 5 minutes outside at his dayjob
love you bro, hope all is well🙏🏽
we just want to learn in our own environment with and from people who share similar experiences and actually want to help us succeed.
. search t "berobed" in the article. i gave you evidence embarrassing for the trump family. not surprised you reject it.

hysterical i am sure for the fish dying now from all the oil leaked as we bring foreign oil due to hillary's deals.

fall weather is best weather

i know 😔 i'm sorry
screw climate change lets worry about americans who are suffering
idk why this still has to be said as cis people, we have no dictation on what is or isnt transphobic or dysphoric.
hillary can't make a deal but she sure know how to steal

that episode was so intense
every president for decades. but now hrc runs, and you cry crocodile tears.
trump has rallied &amp; legitimized a fleet of straight white people convinced they're the brave revolutionaries in a war against everyone else.
of course she hired him and paid him as a foundation "consultant" anyway.
you made yourself look this way, kinda like yoshida , sorry brother. now tag me out too while your at it

might’ve been due to some other lesson and you were able to extrapolate.
screenshot of 's post on trump's new threat on hillary's life. he derides her protection, as if he doesn't.

how many hundreds of thousands of civilians has iran helped assad murder in the last 5 years?
bernie voted 97% of time with dem majority, hrc 96.9%.
they have nothing positive about hillary .. their only resort is negative smoke and mirrors about trump
i would care💛
i'm no trump supporter but this argument is intellectually dishonest. he's (poorly) making a point that guns are for protection.
careful dude, you don't want to end up on the wrong end of it. clintons have long arms. :)

hmm, he blocked me for some reason. the undieslover dude. i don't recall having insulted him or offended him! oh well. :'(
yes, i read it. did you? if you had you would know that what you're saying is a lie.
that's big time, i always wanted to go back to the motherland and find out my true roots
great! catching up on the fb pics now!
prophetic hank kunneman who is always right, says god picks trump to win!!!
word, driving around hillbillies and cows in north carolina made you real good 🙃

wow this dude's racism is off charts. location rhodesia? mercenary?
clintons' taxes are revealed. trump's? nah, no need.
wow! is this today?
while it makes sense for the series to have focused around this, i hope the amell family gets focus again, since they were the center of 2.
awesome!!! ❤️
maybe she was gonna suggest you two make breakfast together and then things just sorta got out of hand
a lot of journalists were laid off, but tech and sales were hit harder. i don't think they're giving up on journalism.
no honey, you didn't 🙄
oy. you're admitting on twitter that you look at other women. smh
i told yah..i always take great care of my people..✨🍷
the 24 breezed past us on mt hope
it's not 2 late 2 turn around 🐣
in places like bay area, bldg restrictions are mostly not based on health &amp; safety.
poor calvin. jane's on his case now besides just me.
buddy on the right looks like a young christoph waltz
next part is that trump hits back and then the agitator starts crying and accusing him of being a bully....
elaine thanks for much for rt my story. i plan to join you as an author when my story (in book form) comes out next spring.
clearly they're not a "second-half team" today.
let us know if you have feedback.
ideally the output can be made to spin gracefully, and the resultant movie is easily exportable.
i guess wanking off incessantly also causes memory loss about who you're wanking off to
how could one trust a liar &amp; cheat.
its so much longer than i thought it would be like damn idk exactly how many hours i logged into it but its. a lot

it's ridiculous if you ask me (and nobody did, sadly)
lol smh it true
have outgained fsu 507-173 so far
might be the best meme on the web
i hate this twitter generation. twitter comes about just as bobby leaves, begat a bunch of fairweather and dumb fans.
i think i just threw up in my mouth a little.
this almost looks like a setup!
i was hella shook when i found out dolar broke it i was lowkey heartbroken💔 i loved watching the guys play lol
be honest you like all the attention!
whenever you trump folks are losing an argument you go back to the faux email controversy, laughable and sad. lol
he has me so well trained.
lmaoooo better hurry and get those early bird tickets before they run out.
jackson has thrown the 5th most 20-yard passes (air yards) in all of power 5. he has the highest total qbr (96.4) in all of fbs.

you're disappointed. i'm sorry. stick to it - maybe you'll get lucky.
he didn't say 100%. but i do think those things he mentioned (plus being a woman) factor greatly
tim kaine would be thoroughly confused by that turn of events!

happy birthday bud hope you're enjoying it ❤️ seems like it!
trump 2/2016 implying obama is muslim
yes!!!! and it is driving me crazy!
the show is really solid, always well shot and well acted, regularly well written. only one episode in 8 feels untidy.
excuse me where?
i'm not interested in both sides. this guy will destroy america. we've never faced anything like him.
execution is the only way to stop these illegal lawbreakers who chose to return to us

my new reaction pic
yup! hillary apparently forgot too!
been trying to get on , but i think having a movie out hurts my chances, makes it seem like i'm not an amateur.
's logic totally reminded me of my fifth grader
completely disagree. the limiting factor is stardust, so a function of grinding + pokestop density
you are smart! they are trained to trick smart people. if you weren't smart, they would have left you alone
maybe it was the art style or the community. i just know that it holds a special place in my heart and hope to find another game like it.

the trump foundation is a ponze scheme. he uses other people's charitable donations to buy self-portraits.
lucky for me that is the case, its 5:15 here
so many secrets... so few jail cells!!

an affidavit is just what it is, a sworn written statement under oath to be presented as evidence at a court case.
trump is a financial genius, hillary is unqualified to work at mcdonald's. obama and hillary, two peas.
please get help.
hey kari! morning
it has to go to planets to be useful? how about stations, moons, &amp; asteroids? wbmct &amp; final version seem btr.

omg that was amazing
thank you. those are two top musicians!
if i'm the worst these guys get they're lucky. good that you blew your one tc interaction on this exchange.
kinda like holding someone who's patting you on the back. have to ask george stephanopoulos if he approves.
box set of 24 seasons 1-8 plus the tv movie is all you need actually
that would be an outrage, our only ally in the middle east and our ill advised potus tries to unseat him.
gossips should take heed to that quote!
*opens book* *only three words* *buy my book* “…dammit sam.” *buys books*
girl win one here u will get it when the phone is released
trump serves as a reminder as to what happens when money and the power to influence others falls info the wrong hands'
sorry you feel that way but not all the same
lawgg!! have mercy .
thank you twin, love and miss you too !!❤️❤️
i will seriously consider leaving the country to join the rational part of our world.
islam should be fought. it is a plague upon humanity.
. only have narratives. calling things as they are doesn't fit
problem is we know bolt will go on market. tesla who knows?
what did "democrats do" during lewinsky?
welcome dear friend.
and would they tell if it was a dirty bomb ? what kink of device sends volcano red bubbling &amp; shock waves blocks?

unfortunately it is
but that would be work
what's her approach on the nj blast? the minnesota stabbings? how many americans does she have to "see" falling before she acts?
the nypd were out in force today - for real!
yup dd ! what a great leader! not😂
the hubris of and his patronization of black voter is truly appalling.
i've done that but not in years, little victories
day 5 !! still no sign of my luggage. the ny stage of my trip is nearly over and you still haven't fulfilled the terms of your 1/2

drop the bastard in the middle of syria. trump sucks
mr. "shut that whole thing down". kellyanne is the common denominator w/ this basket of losers.
match ups &amp; you
glad you enjoyed them, doing more feature and column related stuff this season.
new song, no idea when i'll be out but it's one of the most epic things i've done imo. better than born cross-eyed
shame about those usage tables, they look so nice on github.
terrorism is on the front page. keeping americans safe is on the front page. trump will win! 💣🇺🇸
it's vice sports i'm surprised that they even watch football over there.
any idea what jacket brady was wearing yesterday??
shit right?!? game just needs to give up now
revolution just starting.
i am waiting on five invoices and i am about to spazz out if they don't get here by the end of the week.
for real, i’m enjoying his intro way more than i should be, that … i’m excited to be back in school feeling?
not her only problem.
tell you what is not funny, how expensive the fight was just to watch money run and hold most of the fight.
$75 million to be added to the bill to mexico for the wall.
yep, that’s the one. 🌮 &amp; 🏍
exactly, media pushed economy theory. there is some economic anxiety, but trump's rise is fueled by racial resentment and hatred.
how do you feel about declaring free last night?
when can residents go back home to 23/6? thank you for all your work solving this just need this info so i can go home

sad truth..
i think i met that guy on the left
that's cnn so biased watching em makes me sick they must be bought &amp; paid for by clinton foundation
just passed the coliseum lol hella people waiting to get in
obama and a few chosen ones, like the clinton's and gore will get filthy rich. few good looking actors will benefit as well
gates worked for obama and, very closely, with clinton. he's responsible for their policies. if you support him, you support clinton.
just made and produced a song
did hillary promise not to lie?
holy avi😍🔥🔥🍑
girl that wagon 😩 i ain't mad at your progress though.
never really delved in but i'm sure they've gotten play on the station.
disappointed campaign hasn't objected to all upcoming dncmedia debate moderators. "just say no" now.

black kids have far more access to hip hop. should hip hop change to accommodate suburban white kids?

bahahahaha!! they were probably slinging insults till 4am again 😂
when will you return to tv?
dear stupid egg, get the fuck out of my mentions. go learn how to read
my stomach was turning watching her snap
this is the pic of my tv still off. i've had enough fear-mongering. we need facts not trump!
trump will fix that. not a problem if you don't live downwind from pollution. burn, baby, burn! just not near me.
can't argue tech side. don't care about fast. i am interested in adapting old pneumatic concepts. uses of gravity, etc.
poor fans it's a disaster after disaster for them passing on &amp; in 14 😬
are you ok, are you allergic
guessing potus &amp; congress have more important issues than homeland violence. terrible what's going on.
i'm disturbed
can't wait to breathe what he exhales. it's positively disgusting.
hi! great photo, such a nice gesture. do you mind if we use this picture on nbc (tv &amp; web) with credit to your twitter? ty.
this is my hottest take but i think i would have preferred if we would've just drafted adrian peterson instead of joe.
brand new tune
watching joe thomas waste his career blocking for a series of the most untalented scrubs in nfl history has been excruciating.
we know mike has no ego it's evident everyday..
trumpsplaining: deliver birtherism x 5 yrs. minus birtherism x hillary = no apology needed.
republicans have different policies,we want to lift the whole society.so demand needs to be boost.
what the hell is wrong with you? thinking one fucking candidate stops this? and trump at that? trump only increases the violence
and this comes as a surprise because?
i had this product and it's absolutely the best smucker's makes!
yeah but at least, we'd get to see ap make some improbable td runs so at least, it'd be occasionally fun to watch.
what avenue do we have besides voting 2 effect change 28% voted in primary americans are 2 lazy 4 action but we love 2 whine.
do we know if solder is playing? that should dictate bennett’s role today too, right?
i squeaked out, "so, what are you working on?" as if she might say, "ceramics."
might drop today might not idk
no that's not always the case...
yeas my fav too!
hahaha for sure puro effects ang convo 😂
are you saying that islam is a race of people?
not all literals but only string assignment statements.
same question!!! thought it was a dog with glasses!!
i just became a fan of ricardo. i guess hamilton thinks the win should have been handed to him. can he respect the millions instead?
great article though and crazy to see the physical evolution of the game
- apparently they aren't being penalized for the wrong doing-had this happened 10 yrs ago , w/ mayor giuliani be different 4sure
see ur twin brother
it's to counterbalance the 100% of obama supporters who hate america to their very core.
you accused me of not thinking just because i'd like some evidence before making a conclusion.
soooo strange. usually i kid about shit like this but..
i think shane might be mad at me if i don't run😂😂 he told me were getting in shape for next year😭
i'm not zooming in that far i'll leave that to you
i will, thanks!
he wasn't even listening to kaine. the curse of the "tough question"
we were there yesterday! hope the vendys were fun. it was a gorgeous day.
just curious, so you didn't get to cast a provisional vote? i live in brooklyn &amp; saw 6 people who were purged &amp; had to do that.
yes- is that why we're electing a fascist now? scary
exactly. i think there are a lot of men who have a problem with a women as president
my room mate just said "are you okay?? you have vomit on your shirt...."

hi aly! thanks for being a flower petal! however we are no longer available in canada. so sorry about that.
come after you check out the room! cause i get off at 8:30 remember. i can't take lunch early lol
have to because of the uni internet
very sorry! i must have misunderstood. it's easy to do with only 140 characters. trump!!!
of course it's terrorist! no common bad guy males sly targets civilians! absurd
man said liverpool hahaha only man city would pose a small threat to arsenal 2000-2005
favorite newspaper of trump's great-grandfather.
don't chose science reporting! the people that think pluto should still be a planet are tenacious as wolverines
and how are u going to stop a lone wolf attack if it was terrorist inspired?
this is what happens when the gm's voice probably wasn't as heard to hire rex/marrone.
oh sure! your facts from fox news, like the black on white crimes....kkk i am tired of you now. you sound dumb
non related microcephaly occurs 12 out of 10,000 births other causes incl stroke, drugs, alcohol
oh it would be all trump's fault. they'd be besides themselves with glee.
great! we will check it out! have a good race day!
that's quite an assumption that i watch only fox news don't you think? but is it easier to fit me in that bubble?
in the meantime, declaring "it's definitely terrorism" is irresponsible. we define "terrorism" a specific way for very good reasons /4
please vote
i really should
that's like calling an openly gay person gay and expecting it to sting. it's just like, right and i'm cool with it...

how many have you and i broken, and jesus stays the same. he died for every commandment we break.

i realized that they are allotropes when it was revealed that weev coached shanley kane.
elm is awesome! i started playing w/ it. agree it's not 100% there yet tho, some stuff is wip (eg css)

how are they being scammed?
(if it were obvious, somebody would have done it already, right?)

stand on the shoulders of those before you &amp; copy their recipe for the time being.

this isn't even a picture of her, it's her body double, another lie she perpetrates on americans
this violence is directly connected 2 trump's campaign of hate and fear. he should be made to stand in front of the police line himself
you mean like obama cutting the supply side 1.4 t debt he inherited by 1 t?

just accept my e-copy. tf. its the same damn content
ne means it only for "the blacks".
they lost their loyalty to the country over a snub for baby boy jeb's candidateship. gswb wouldnt consciously do it.
certainly trying to talk to racist cop that is supported by a racist system won't do anything
--- straight up!
we clearly have no strategy right? it keeps happening right? it has happened throughout our history here right?
that's your perception you clearly are not getting my point
folks mixing up who designed what. it's easy to get em mixed up.

i blame the msm for not hammering on trumps lies!! they side step them and don't call them lies.

islam is of satanic origin....

by the way what does yall mean?
it's so good if you watch an episode of the show and listen to the corresponding podcast (makes the show so much richer).

show me a list of all nfl qbs who have lasted 17 years (as beuerlein did). how many don't you recognize?
the guy who put his hand out for me to stop while directing his friend to drive in reverse in the bike lane takes the cake
those who excuse violence, arson, looting, assault and vandalism by trying to call it "protest" are complicit, obviously

i like the launch 3 for short runs but too "floppy" over 4-5 miles.

while the old pottermore is my fav and imo embodied the 'harry potter aesthetic' at the same time it was always very focused-
yeah did i hear ya loud and clear. couldn't agree more
wasnt just cool ancient old wizard stuff. it was as much i think about re-imagining old tropes and classic themes-
as very new and stylish. so shrug! i'm a fan, even if i prefer the old one, because the new pottermore is just as relevant.

yes, only for the reservations from the confirmed app.
don't be afraid, glenda. report immediately to richard dean anderson. everything will be fine.
gasp! graphic novel? thoughts??
anyways, after i gave him the food, he takes out pens and says,"here please take one!!"
that's on the update?
and obama only won young white men by 1 point in 2008
i was very unhappy with him last weekend. especially thursday game.
they're not allowed to give anything away. she could just be saying what the writers and producers want her to say.
amazing! the trick is to rub your hands together like crazy and not get it wet.
i literally sneezed on him and he didn't move
that right hand from hell! congrats
grasping at straws
actually you know that makes sense since he's going to be giving a big talk tomorrow
she definitely has the connects
cause ppl need to physically see the to seperate orders.. or they feel played 😂
cleveland's got your back. throw your game.
i understand that, but this is something i personally never heard anyone complain about so i asked.
ah, fair enough! haha
but snap spectacles are conspicuous. wearing sunglasses whose only function is to record is an obvious sign, like holding up a phone.
he seems mildly uncomfortable
wasn't just him... ultimately it comes down to the players getting the job done
i want someone to grab my ass like that
most people*
additionally, the design of snap's spectacles are much more inviting and playful (and way less dorky) than that of…
what is your favorite cover so far btw i love you ❤️
ok. now i havent heard from yall in over 30 minutes
he just doesn't want fans to get all worked up over something that might not even happen.
if snap inc. finds it has a hit on its hands with spectacles, they'd be smart to forget the "limited" and help users get ahold of them
stop @ ing me god
wow 25 things it's amazing i just told about 4 to a friend cop of mine !!
and "work harder and better" and "join together and become one". gtfoh.
that was only a minute?! wow! it was jam packed!

a "one candidate is a fascist and the other is too craven &amp; weak willed to offer a moral contrast" thing.
i will be there tomorrow for the wnba playoff game

500 what, dicks?
1d stans are crazy it's so funny but i'd have done the same thing
wish i could favorite this 100 times
and the disgraced politician is weiner, pronounced like wiener.
yes because trump supporters kept making stupid comments
and kept promoting violence by saying they should all be locked up or worse
she is a serial liar too!
simple math makes this one a 340% more weak..... this can be great return in stock market but not in statistics of lost soldiers
an argument could be made that a sanders candidacy would've damaged biden less (1/2)
that's stupid! just drop out all ready
trump is very ignorant. if president obama (the black guy) acted this way as a candidate, he would not be president today.
and we all know how long that lasted....
fish-on-fridays is another of those “weird” things catholics everywhere must revive
it was many years ago &amp; you used to have jermaine as your friend
i agree with you wholeheartedly; a mix of delirious surrealism and madcap humor!

sad thing is...you're absolutely right.
oh my gosh!! that is awful. 😢
i don't assume that. again, i confused you with someone else..99% of my interactions right now with racists who are white
so weird! i'm searching your name, i don't see anything at all. 😿 i don't think it went through somehow.
sounds made up
clear as day i saw this at age 4
when are you gunna release "thotty"?? been listening to the radio clip on loop for way too long 🔥
i hate that. 😩
i don't even have $200 in my bank account lol
yeah that douche should definitely take the guy fawkes mask off
was it directed by alan smithee? 😉
u can call me.... the oracle
cable news is reliant on twitter already. sport'll be next. drama is somewhat immune, i reckon.
summarizes the meh-ness well. season 2 ended on a high note and looking forward to season 3
weakest response ever. ok, just take it off the 2-day or prime list then. it's not prime deliverable. that's all. just be honest
sorry ...but hopefully the move is a good thing
someone took my pore strips and i had to choose between eyebrows and biore so i chose brows 😂 thanks though babe

my submission, though only for startup articles where no amount of math would help ... :p
i guessed "ave maria" before clinking the link. damn, i was close.

broad shoulders!! our bay area stations need to start playing it-gotta keep requesting!
nice try like clinton, people with wealth create trusts for their heirs. ask your own tax attorneys idiot. small bus ???
do you deliver in new york yet or are you currently limited to the saint louis area?
in fact, many latino americans are good people!…
same here, unless parents are having their kids very very young, in which case we the human race are screwed
of course..
meanwhile i’ve had a rather pleasant experience… as much as it disgusts me to say that

im just imagining your hand cam only it's just mosaic'd censorship
like i'm not trained in music theory beyond rhythms, but melodies and chord progressions r a cakewalk compared to making a good snare
it's nice to get to know people though don't be so shy all the time
most or little you can at least try but don't try to hard

no question, bruce. his program is built on toughness and winning up front on both lines of scrimmage.
praise jesus 🙌😂
"oh god how's he holding that thing?! is that... six middle fingers?! guys we better censor this, this is way too obscene"
but a camera for the purpose of capturing ar content, no?
right, a "hispanic" male. when was the last time a hispanic person started killing people randomly at a mall?
jam the fuck out of this
everyone gets mad when i hate on nyc but lol no never no bye no thanks
👀👀👀👀👀 i'm curious now
sorry. twitter character limit makes this kind of discussion difficult.
yup. not the character of usc the way things are going. the row scene is a disgrace from what i hear
he's hispanic for sure. white people described him as such so i believe it.
like with auto-advancing slides. it's a venture.
oooh downloading now and saving for later! so excited to listen to this one!
omg how come nobody told me otho is in this
yes but with a lot less 3rd party interoperability
hrc is a self righteous moron, a legend in her own mind. only a mindless simpleton votes 4 her!

depending on the age of this girl you could be in some hot water
ooooops, well, if i have any excuse, i was drinking a lot when i retweeted that. lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

i mean i wouldn't have cared either way hence the judge me idc tweet
wish i could be there for that!
i'm the girl
you are the kindest. i'm very proud of that song. it's very long.
yet for much of the campaign many in the media really never held him accountable to what he was saying. it's only been (1/2)
will you write a follow-up now that luckey has publicly said he's not voting for trump?
pictures too stupid asses
it’s a bad excuse but it is an excuse! that’s why i have hella plans already
seriously, don't worry about it

another completely unedited shot - seen through fifth floor window on cafe5 corridor

fosho bro good luck and read that book!
ooooooooo u got them!!!!!!

yo is this like budget round 1 or some shit
i know right? disgusting, but those people exist. happens way too often. deplorable!
real presidential! acting like a 10 yr old bully again!
evan calling it a "toy" sets a much different narrative than other companies announcing new hardware.

calling anyone an animal is fucking dumb. but specifically sorting it by race makes it dumb and racist.
at least im not super drunk anymore that would have been bad but also i mysteriously dont need to pee anymore?
i feel like you tweet this every night
it bothers me but i'm to tired to go on and clean them. i have figured out a way to make it not get any bigger though.
bet this "endorsement" was really a way for to get attn again from the media. he's missed the spotlight.
haha ok well if i see you in person expect me to come up to you
was i blessed or is there still a chance barneys will finesse me and cancel? 😂
yup, keep having gun free zones and this is what happens.

peppermint is better

nut butter is very very good.
it must be hard living so scared of everything. no citizen has ever stopped active shooter. facts.
hi verquil, we're full right now. and no, unlikely, we don't e-mail back every app.
they will only do at where there is very large scale supply of milk. like dannon
that's actually a smart pivot, applying cop structure to more basic sitcom situations rather than sitcom comedy applied to cop situations
had a piece on it
guess i'm kinda like the you never had... tho.
no advertisers, no money, no twitter.
wait, focus too😩
he sounds like he wears these type of glasses and has a cole sprouse haircut
well, he smeared himself by being an asshole, and i didn't have anything to do with the assholes that targeted her.
of course he says that while not following a christian life
yes, what an era. :)
as someone said elsewhere, he's trying to buy friends, but should've bought better taste.
try cutting out life and see how bad music reacts xd
horned serpent, wampus, thunderbird, and pukwudgie
oh, definitely will get in touch with you. the only friend i have in there is but she quit the game.
any of the below will work
i managed to sleep right through three alarms
codecave != codecoverage ?
you do know it's okay to curse on the twitter ..?
u rock...thanks hun!
yea tfa feels more modern :)
i can't look at my nieces and say i voted for dt a man who raped a 13 yr old girl
true, so it can be generalized into the other categories. good point!
i can't look at my country's flagand vote for donald who loves putin, a dictator and brutal murderer
lmao people are just like "you're that guy who tweets/posts on facebook a lot!"
yes, i've wanted her to stick with white. but i seriously doubt hillary gives a damn what i think lol
given that, it is entirely possibleas state polls lag a week or 2behind nat polls, that her st n's go up
the un is standing by, watching!
this segment jumped the shark, i have this mop and it is great but this was corny.
10/ btw, the ostensible—and a legit practical—reason for not encrypting everything, including private fiber links, was cpu usage.
kinda like ...most we hear, reed are bein compensated to state what they say...i am not; i do it 4 ppl
yes whole nation is standing next to pakistan army except actors, singers and players. they've love for $$$$$ only
there was a time when the put the game on a large screen in the old social club.

it usually suggests what the hashtag is based on the few letters.
shop at your own risk... malls are going the way of the 5 &amp; dimes..sad state of affairs...obama should keep up islamic immigration
wtf i'm that old
😂😂😂 hope you guys having a blast
america wants deceptive clown &amp; evasive clown gone...the elites believe americans are all drugged up&gt;not
they can't issue statements unless their elite fascist global handlers want them too...all a greek tragedy
he probably will have her stool and defibrillator too😂
i believe there is some global minimum amount of dumbbells and treadmills that allow them to claim a "gym" on-site
we will find out what she has been saying in those paid speeches to a bunch of idiots that were just looking to get into our pocket
nothing will change without a proper resolution of the kashmir conflict, that's the ground reality
lets first talk about human rights in kashmir, palestine, syria, yemen, sudan, somalia, iraq etc..
then what do we call those police that are racists?
oh boy...not sure she will understand what a metaphor is...i tried to dumb it down..lol
let me know how i can support your org. i'm down the street
excuse me? he won those debates, dominating his rivals, and won at the polls. who he is: winner. fact.
what did he yell while cowardly shooting at people? what are the authorities &amp; media hiding to continue helping the establishment?
all the nachts.
oy vey...see that woman is mentally challenged...
including breadsticks?
so excited we get 2 c ur racist retrograde humor on a national platform👍🏾
that's me and i go to sleep. i'm so over it 😩 i be ready to quit. but i need me sugar daddy first lol
but the defense is still taking too many risks...
i love green too, but i think we will be electing unwittingly trump, who promotes more coal and other fossils
everyone should try to drop rednessie
yea i do and get to get lit tonight if i have to. but them closing shifts thou 💀
i honestly thought we were talking about the case we were watching lol :) whoops.
no, she was against immigration into the us.
what's the occasion?
the first press screening at tiff was up against something big too. maybe monster calls?
your history
she should be in jail. now hillary is asking for minority votes? thats all she sees minorities as is…
would hire her, , , , , , , , , , and
i rarely use twitter but your name popped up
that's a scientific fact
i didn't even know son said that until just now 😭😭
still running her fat ugly mouth..wow..lol
though won't need the distraction of cuban2have roll right off the track&amp;in2 crazyland
&amp; what continues to crack us up is the fairy tale that he was ever a respected businessman here 😂
who gives a shit the first thing that pops into your mind is a race/ethnicity debate.
i certainly have a hard time understanding the descendants of enslaved people here being ok with the american promise
awesome pink!💖🙏🏽
all due credit to for great pics/video and good company on our journey, special thanks to for letting me run with this.
ok. so he just counted himself out. but wait there are going to be people who are going to believe him anyway.
the universe has ears djc..
doesn't he always seem to do that?? he tries to let pitchers get through it...
trump ask her why she allow her man to molest all those woman in the white house like monica
it's always telling when people cite a woman being "fake" as the reason they don't like her.
can we get you to come back to sf soon?
sounds great! is she on twitter? does she ever get to nyc?
maybe my luck is turning around
that's republicans for ya
hillary is not getting obama's turnout from 2012 not even close . so that 2012 comp is out the window
don't be a hater
"flatly lied on tv"???? we've had 16 months of that! jeez.
this some white people ass shit
and this time she won more votes and delegates. it wasn't even especially close . . .
still that's city's strongest team possible. they should rout swansea. 4-0.
if internet fights started with "we need mediation as a general rule because people can't be trusted!" things'd be better
but she just shot herself for no reason and blamed a phantom black man. and the cover story she came up with even makes her look bad.
amen coach ditka. you dont want to put your hand on your heart in protest ok. but you get your ass up and show respect for 🇺🇸
yup. young for mata. standing ovation
robin williams, jeff bridges, and mystical bowel movements -- poop and happiness, all in one scene.

no 1 else cares about this tower matter encroaching your personal space, queen amy. no 1!
thanks! that was a crazy day to visit.
it is a slippery slope or a dead end. they will never let him be nominated unless he becomes 1 of them. we need a new party.
the blind support of police corrupts the force and leads to "stand your ground" policing.
next they will start wearing flannel and tool belts, fix cars and do home renovations.
i am lucky i work and live here. my favorite place.
thanks buddy ❤️ love you
if she's savvy enough she can correct him &amp; get her own out in one breath. that would win lots of people.
feeling is rather mutual. he is my héros de cidre (and just an extremely nice guy).
had to get into a full debate about why it doesn't work when it's only targeting a certain group and the bookings system here is slow shit.
woot!!! congrats ladies and all the love!!!
then they cheap af with the "breakfast" they provide. like my nigga why would i want all these dry ass bagels?
i had a complaint about a staff member and you gave him my cell and had him call me?!?
thor vs bum in the wildcard game. still a lot of baseball left but i am already nervous.

"well according to your website.........so that contradicts what you are saying now, so which is it?"

miss your writing andy. hurry back!
yes senator cruz stop obama the dems mama!!!
i'm so happy i could help i love you so much ❤️
it's not vindictive; it is absolutely something you have to disclose.
i know. but it's her job to correct. that's leadership &amp; presidential. not expecting daddy to intervene.
the camera is always on. don't give these idiots something else to talk about. love you my sister!
a party in every assortment!
stunning, electric when uninjured &amp; on the field. poison the rest of the time. hope he gets it 2gether. could be a good dude.

we don't need kasich he was kissing obama's butt over the tpp disaster giving it his full support. his career is over
beautiful artistic pic, it's a true art
leno is so fucking poor , karius is the next neuer
14 to be continued so you want to mute me now.

ahhhhh haha i respect that
gel catch this scum
sorry to hear that

trump tax plan raises taxes on millions of middle class families. read on new study:
if only you could see him thursday too since he's doing two shows there
yeah and justin looked at me then
. building off that, when you hit your car horn an equal decibel noise should sound inside your car
lmfaooo. don't start.
. i wonder how heidi &amp; lee harvey cruz will vote. only good thing dt has done was expose tc for weasel he is
we can make that happen, clearly there's enough to go around
you could also check on ticket master to see if they have extra tickets for thursday
i think i'll be posting another shot from this shoot in next month's
you didn't call him a stupid idiot y2j has gone soft
all lives matter white too
but... it needs to be 2px bigger @

maybe that's not the president some people want for their daughters but is definitely the husband.....
isn't "beat the kid senseless" the real news here?
cancer is man made the government give ppl that just ain't like the appearance it's not serious
those were my first thought.
animals feel. sometimes much more than humans.
i literally just found out. if it was a police shooting. it would be breaking news
which library ? bc my library fugazy.
that doesn't mean that i like it though. the show is gonna suck without her.
congrats all hail the king &amp; queen of wwe,you guys are inspirational &amp; ya'll always know what's best for business :)

you sound moronic equating clinton to trump. how many women have accused trump of rape?

finally, voting for trump will not "speed up the revolution." grow up.
he wouldn't have made the finger print mistake if angie didn't throw his game off by coming home. but that's his fault
hillary, the candidate that wants to expand war in syria, is trying to make world a better place? gotcha.

mr overrated!
trump is a hedgehog in that no matter how you approach him, he’s still a prick.

(i wasn't going to be the one who said it and this is why i rely on you for the heavy lifting.)
but what about the data that is already available. is that informing how ppl of color are being treated?
lmao... in and out of self induced unconsciousness.,.. lol

i'm in new york &amp; we have a debate party planned 😊 lead up is crazy- eg. should be invited, as trump threatens
i mean ooooh (not pooh!) 😆
i have lost all faith in it and comey? s disaster.
might need to move to your neck of the woods come november... well see how this election goes 😯
trump said he was a democrat so he was either lying or she is
ai and machine learning have been used pretty interchangeably for some time now
figured. hence checkin with you
. hillary supports tpp (despite what she says now) which would raise poverty and hurt middle class.
ha! i guess that's what i was inferring myself. i can't watch these other shows when the original masterpiece still reigns! ☺️
don't forget he talks about potentially adding 10 more to the list at a single party
it does over the giants. you can't dispute the math and the tie break rule.
criminal act endorsed by president obama &amp; ag lynch..sad
hey man, if you're so worried about trump winning, why don't you just move to canada
that's true, but why the need to live in sf? anywhere would do for developer, say a nice suburb in michigan or colorado.

they're probably just getting old!! all my milani lipsticks have gotten old and are gross now.. just swap them out w new ones :)
i read treyf and its like a good stew with things all mixed together good things yet it needed a good editor and focusser
also, it would be interesting to see what % of the debate audience (incorrectly) expects the moderator to pipe up when somebody lies...
undisciplined team...hc should've had a talk with the team + throw in erratic eli and there you have it
we both picked rachel bloom!!!!
...when she has to insist that, no, she did not travel to benghazi to personally execute amb. stevens, or some such...
it really ain't 😭

no it is worse than that, it is more: this one guy he allegedly knows who allegedly is an mit grad allegedly said this.
i'll be in class so he's making me have to leave the room to get those tickets he's basically destroying my education
finish debate and finish the myth of his statements that he was against dynastic party leaderships

leaked emails show she promoted fracking globally while sos. now says she wants "safe" fracking in us. that doesn't exist.
i'm sure someone already mentioned this, but the "two right hands" thing is distressing.
so, 9 for each candidate.
and knock on some doors, make some calls.. (except 1 in 20 at best pick up the phone this year).
can u blame her she's been with lunatic liar trump for 1 year
more and more, trump is proven to be right and on track to restore us to peace and prosperity.
good morning

its tough being a gen x parent.
each person who was selected in the lottery got an individual code that only works for them :(
i feel the same way about a good portion of the population tbh
careful mate, that's both my parents....
even something as simple as this the campaign refuses to admit it was a lie.damn right we need 2 fact check the debate
don't forget your bag on the train! 😜
please check the images for the details
lmao this is funny you right

i believe the wall text was referring to a specific area?
that's amazing!

how about i just call you ding dong instead? it's easier for me to pronounce.
yeah cause sfc is illuminati
only way to watch the debate without critical comments is with cspan.

what was goff? just curious
honestly which of you dykes is taking me apple picking
lol very!!! he looks like an old carpet!!!
i really enjoyed the talk, are slides available online?
well it turned out that i bought the food and gas so not so much
people have given up on democracy. democracy demands that you share with others. trump supporters want a tyrant to favor them.
trump is pulling off the greatest bait/switch of all time. elect him &amp; you get more of the disastrous g.w. bush years.

good point.

you don't understand the struggle, man
. you believe trump respects all people. his dad was a racist in the kkk. his sons quote white supremacists.
you chatten come to this !
no, he doesn't. he lives in a world where certain people, like war cirminals &amp; torture implementer shouldn't be embraced.

they're obviously appealing to those "millenuals" everyone keeps talking about.
i take this entire tweet back, he doesn't have to. he doesn't owe anyone that. me 15 seconds ago was an idiot, i'm a changed person.
he's worried ppl will ask questions about raheel shereef ext. &amp; his indian investments
yup, for sure. it's not that far as the crow flies, but it's a pain to get around that corner - and i-81 can be brutal n of syr.

seasonal allergies = the third party interloper in tonight's debates. imagine if hillary was the one sniffling? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
that is a winning combo
thank my teenage son! he's hooked on the bingo aspect of this debate!!
he can't remember what he said 5 seconds ago
i don’t think could stand to be that close to
it's standard practice to read word for word? because she doesn't even look at the crowd when she talks
yeah ok... lol
mayyyybe. though i would maybe put money on it being called the "trump suite" instead.
well in that case it's true!
can't i retweet this a million times
they used the time off to make her drug cocktail "just so" but yeah she is likely at the end of her rope
🙄 im just pointing out something
report, then block.
she is a wizard
you not even from here, "african american communities are being decimated by crime." shut up.
oh yea lol that too!!
lol all i'm saying is that for his personality, he might as well just say "yeah i said that fuck it.. it's what i think"
ed i think i'm having a stroke
a magic 8-ball would make a better president.
all i hear is my hotel, my properties mine mine mine
blowing the racist dog whistle.
but not at laguardia. that place is is from the toilet.
nothing because is the most incompetent company on the planet and has an outage on my block
love i cant. i will get a heat rash :(
yep he did. that's because he hasn't been to a third world country to know the difference
joaozinho is a god
what policies has hillary expounded?
not fair to peter.
yo this is a huge implosion, anyone who claims he won tonight is a lunatic
like...with that bs
** vaccine-questioning or pro vaccine safety or "parental choice" or "health freedom" or a gazillion more weasel words
best tweet of the night!
also always has that thing on his face in the dome too. very off putting.
you'll love it! watched it a few weeks back
that's a lie!
whomever wins i'm looking for property in uruguay
please don't make me go on that bus tour.
jim you need to eat something. maybe a hot pocket.
trump properties in chicago matter! (to trump)
me too. and that they resent smart women, so her reason works against her. this is my fear.
boom there ya go
trump said during the debate that buying houses when the market crashed was good business!
omg look at the fucking demographics. chill out bro
the tax thing will cut through
nope !!! haha
omfg gangs of new york
they’ll be on youporn within the hour
he better not
should be in this right now.... but alas.
i wish. half the country is still going to be dick riding him tomorrow
agreed...so annoying. and his it's hillarys fault, and obamas fault. he probably blames them for this heat today...
did trump just blow the debate in ? let's hope left leaning undecideds just woke up!!
&amp; trump's will kill millions, ur point? sadly, 1 of the 2 on stage will be prez. choose wisely
hillary was not only in favor of the war but did her best to sell it. she was an eager participant.
he's wrong. he's wrong, and she's right - she spoke about the beauty of the black communities she's seen.
you're right it hasnt dropped, its risen.
there's that. i'm comforted.
the water drinking, too
and tbh it would've been an effective attack point for trump but he's too busy talking about... lol
knowing what is and what isn't constitutional is a pretty good start.
i will be sad on the day svu is over.
i feel this on an emotional level irl rip ****
she did answer. she said everyone had implicit bias.
yes but has also said he regrets these policies in hindsight. like so many things in life.
nana is so, so happy that your back home with me i missed you all
i just can't b
ugh...i'll try to find it again.
so far at least, they are being so true to type that it's, well, boring. im her with wit and nowhere to put it
says the ctr troll with 40 followers making 30 cents a tweet. too funny.
you shouldn't have to argue this :(
i know i'm already dreading all of those fun assignments :)))
drink every time trump says china
alex in the second pic is me everyday😂
his eyes are getting more pale too. i was surprised how evenly contrast was on his face was for a change at the start.
he was speaking about new york and the data is false ...
i was thinking of the sound effect heard at the start of the show. i thought they were going for a gavel sound.
:( you got me through many nights when i was security officer in the 90s.please at least start your own podcast.
90 non - commercial minutes
stop tweeting
i assume it’s very similar to runkeeper live?
you have an egg as ya profile pic hold this l
what's a troll bot?

you always lucifeeeeeee
h, you were sleeping. -t
what words? "terrific"? "thousands"? "billions"? "tremendous"? "believe me?" yeah, i think that's all he got.
bro the conversation is resolved.
an empty sandwich box now
of corse donald trump wants to dismiss the race issue, he struggles with bringing people together
and so are oompa loompas like dis one right here 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
70s today right now 68
i miss you too my boy! i'll be back 😘 thanks for coming ❤️
mind blowing
and i'm kinda happy to be australian
she's a giant douche. he's a turd sandwich.
no, ari. she is saying that all americans are "implicitly biased". racism and biases are different things.
it was to help obama
he's delusional you go clinton ya the speech he's wife tried to copy
someones gonna be up all night
who knows lol
its horrific in any way: that he tweeted it, denied it, and may/may not have deleted. even 2/3 is deplorable.
surprised it took that long
the best years of america's existence were founded on democratic socialist principles. you're ignorant.
holy shit lol “we settled with no admission of guilt” as a point of pride. amazing.
fire up the dimensional shitter
thanks, we'll need it.
i understand all the choices we been giving has been terrible.
just been saying this it's so annoying
"very easy to do" settling housing discrimination lawsuit, says trump
war damn spreading e coli.
trump seems so proud about settling. i thought he was all about winning?
ugh i wish he would just do it
h, vagina is not a qualification. you are corrupt! you are a liar! i demand you out! period.
note he didn't say it was false. he just said he didn't admit guilt.
frightening!
nacho chips &amp; cranberry juice!!!! 😉
that is the most perfect summation
hillary if you are not a racist, trump if you are, the republican party if you don't care about the election outside of this
he opened a club in one of the whitest communities in the world. he didn’t have to discriminate.
oh come on, what about hillz self promoting herself every 5 mins? i had no idea she wrote stronger together book. when? how? lol
im 100 feet away but my roommate is in there
no there's no heat. i just don't need to hear big mouth assholes spew their bullshit on my feed.
anything about rec and parks or cbd-managed downtown spaces getting closed to public for party rentals when so little parks
😂😂yet overkill exodus testament &amp; death angel our killing it
it was! im so excited for next season..young bloods and vets
i think i'm gonna need an investigative trip to fl to check this place out.
looked like he was about2go find a casket&amp;lay in it..at least that was how he looked walking intodebatehall
low expectations strike again!
i don't trust islands...wait...
can you post the link to it
you mean like what hillary has done? check youtube for how she contradicts herself!!!
maxine knows
he's a hot mess
there is no doubt in my mind you will be the commander in chief. feeling happy!
how did h's foundation donor get on a top-secret national security board without any experience?
lmao, that's him
completely can't get over that sniffle
yup let's give her a glass of water
everybody was doing it....
who needs practice
i think he was doing better earlier. but i don't think what she's saying helps hillary with moderates...
send help &amp; citizenship plz
that's absurd
gimme a time and day im down every single day homie.
(yes, i know, but sounded like it)
you and me both
tell me about it 😏
dude people not in workforce is 90m+
i hear a ad here.
he is so good with these computers 💻
am i mentioned?
pretty sure he means the ice-delivery service workers union.
ny has the highest home tax in america people barely living out here. you gotta have a million side hustles to live in ny.
i want to be fat on my couch so badly. i'm making good progress
oh that's a sick image. that's no combover. that's a wig.
last time i checked, federal agencies like ice don't endorse candidates
pretty sure he's making a nerd joke
he's trying hard to piss everyone off!
i can't. i just lost my shit on that one.
great episode. but that's unfortunately dead wrong.
maybe it was goldfinger or lex luthor.
his campaign just announced he'd get a cabinet position
:eyes you suspiciously:
she resorted to acting like she gives a crap
haha! i actually thought that too! but they must have coordinated?
tell me about how incredibly beautiful the trump foundation is. go on.
i believe so in the 2008 election. such a lying hypocrite
“we aren’t doing cyber even though it’s very hard“ is the name of my death metal band from 1994
if you think the "bad guys" in chicago have a long kill record peep hillary's shawty basically has an honorary feature on finally rich
hell is a bracket above what i'm living in
fact check whether these beds exist
fbi to return thousands of recovered to state department for potential release.
the is winning and the are losing
does he weigh 400 pounds and work out of his room too?
trump's son will solve cyber security. big relief to those of us in silicon valley.
lol not too greedy are ya? ☘️🏈☘️💙💛💚
his son is very good with the computer.
thank you. more then half the people complaining aren't even able to vote
p.s. "too", not "to"... &amp; not deaf. just smarter
disagree, she looks nervous and not making the most when djt falters
i dont. i think they are both contemptible but she is so deceitful he authentically bigoted
first, asl? u a cop?
has never nor will it ever turn a profit.
girrrll, me too! me and my sister were just speaking about him and that nasty ass sniffing.
cuz ufc knows msg will be a sellout based on the newness factor. they can put anyone on the card
i can try, but i'm going to be traveling for half of next month! what's the costume?
i miss him already
and he's just great at it. huge talent.
why would you wish such awfulnes on me? 🙀
huh por que
this is like a warm up for me when i watch the bills/rex vs patriots/belichick this weekend
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
but trump does not represent america, as a fact of matter he represents the snob 1%
none of that was your fault. its the law to have your dog on a leash :-)
i'm hearing good &amp; bad things, idk if i should even bother watching it 😩
fix cyber and we’ll remove you
coding for all
yeah. check her emails too honey
he looks like a god damn coconut lol
i am so anticipating the view tomorrow whoopi is it us or is this motherfather a dam idiot
it has more rts than votes
have consumed multiple cookies
nope. i just finished my first day of classes 😂
so refreshing to read this
we learned that hillary is still lying n manipulating the people.
i haven't given lots of thought to nato. um that's a problem.
gotta save something good for next time
dude, she's kicking his ass. he is a buffoon who speaks in generalities and is incapable of the temperament req'd to be potus
the only thing he drops more than f bombs are cyber bombs.
i.. it's almost as if... can only women be sick?!
you are the real invalid here, imbecile
my twitter is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i believe it's gonna be a great week for us all donna! 👍🏽
i'm just trying to encourage my girl while she slays.
i didn't talk bad about you my friend asked me what i was doing saturday
do your research dear. lowering taxes on the wealthy is what caused the recession.
thought we forgot about ye, lightning? yer next!
you can do better.
how about undergrads?
we should have stopped isis in 2014 when we first identified the problem ?
i didn't understand y trump brought up his 10 y/o son, all kids in usa know the computers very well
there's no systemic racism in the system; you lie! isolated incidents of police misconduct aren't systemic. tell the truth!
he sounds a bit like a confused teenager
thank you!💕✨
you're a real one because if all hell breaks lose this is a serious request
that's what i was implying, sorry if that wasn't clear
hey lindsay, shoot me an email iam at and i'll see if i can help!
there you go again, it's all words
twitpic or it didn't happen
i *literally* just said the same thing!
well it was v thoughtful of you tyvm
laughter in the room. gotta be killing him.
omg i'm laughing right now. better temper. please he just got upset a few seconds ago
she's wiping the floor with him.
he'd make a great first dog.
send me a link
that's what i'm sayin!
no one screaming about emails makes sense anymore. what security risks are they screaming about?
catch us at the bailes and jaripeo sim so excited 😻
i am at 1% battery too
angry orange man
you guys are terrible! sad!
i'm watching with a baby who took one look at trump and was like, stfu old man and fell asleep
at peak can't, huh?
share a link plz
damn i had al bundy in the pool
haha. i feel for that poor woman.
ay, he could be gay straight bi, he show up on the field and is nice, he my nigga
isis is a creation of obama's administration.
not the theatrical cut, no.
oh, i don't think that's the best example of racism; he wouldn't have respected any moderator.
i think she just hides it better. secret service has great stories about her.
and the fact checkers find?
why is he getting so much time. is everyone afraid of this buffoon ?
i love mattresses. i own properties in mattress.
well if trump would give just one straight answer and not hem &amp; haw or just give an answer period, lester might lay off
its a good night to troll tinder n okc
pot calling kettle black... your policies have been proven not to work
i just know right from wrong i don't need a president who's just going to tell me everything is gonna be okay
no she's just laughing that her entire life's work has amounted to a debate with a cultural joke like trump. the irony.
he's lying.. nobody believes you even your family trump you are dumb!!!
or any time he interrupted lmao
the word is presidential.
the mute button, i think you mean
clau dont scare jas away ha! 😂
at the debate trump should hit hillary hard like libya, email server &amp; clinton fundation. trump is on the defensive.
me too, friend. me too.
omg i've always wanted to go
he gave me a pinecone im better thanks to my friends you hlped too
i had a feeling i was spelling his name wrong lmfaooo
he has a political buzz word generator under that podium
which channel? we haven't seen that.
gotta love tulo. been a great jay
sit down, climate hoax pushing, phony a leftist disgrace..
why is lester not asking hillary about emails? clinton foundation? he's not being neutral n uses kid gloves on hrc. disappointing
some really terrible coke though. no energy or confidence at all.
i feel like every rightfully mean, negative thing has already been said.
wtffff. your insane?? it's worth so much more
yup, about 14 months ago. how is the guy still here?
looking forward to "of cybers and nuclears". in the end, cyber hits nuclear with a hammer and ends the world.
😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂 duly noted
oh dear god his answer to that is even worse. no real amazing witty soundbites, eh
orange trump lol
she's knowledgable and qualified. how is that a negative?
allowed too many inexcusable points like.the long fg and roughing punter. this should.be over
because she's not juicing on the 👃🏻🍺s
at one point she was "secretary" which was....interesting
she's an idiot with great stage presence!
omg that gif
lester it's time for you to go home!!!! control the show!!
what's the equivalent of a hangover for straight-edge kids?
tbh rise by
good luck to anyone who can actually find a point in anything he said tonight
girl please. run for mayor, state legislature sumpthin. staph it with this
sometimes that's all it takes. 🙄
you obviously care. you're here trolling her...:)
just an fyi telling me not to criticize a public official is antithetical to my beliefs and principles. never do that to me.
you're wrong! if he does die, he's gonna be brought back okay *ugly cries*
hahah wtf is this
i don't have sphero or ollie but ollie seems to be less educational but more fun to use
who the fuck coach trump wtf this is no good he us not calling her about nothing
they do. it's scary and disheartening
facts!! 😭😭 i hope by nov. america makes the right vote
my dad was in a boardroom with him &amp; said he was actually human, and normal, nothing like the character he's portraying here
holt squandered this opportunity. uninterrupted soliloquies. waste of air time. ps hillary clearly won
any tapers in the house??
for once he is right. he is temperamentally ill to be president.
shes pathetic
can't believe it's par for the course with this asshat
lmao i just said the same thing. trying to parent on stage
lol. no they are nypd's
it's a plasma television
there is no crying in debate!
neither do women, and marginalized groups that have been treated like shit because you have vocal cords
this is two children sitting in the principals office trying to push the blame on one another
honestly, i'll fuck his whole day up. i'll go off for years about it.
thought it was 2 hours?
melania plagiarized michelle's 2012 speech, not this year.
😉 sexy hehe. ever hear about
your not the only one, glad it ended
i want a redo
shots, shots,shots,shots!
did a great job on an insanely unlevel playing field! much was expected and she delivered!
this is the face of mental illness. he isn't well. and we're pointing cameras at him.
commanding performance - you were wonderful!! and likable - great job!!
hope they jump in on an ants marching set.
ahhh, the classic "idk what the fuck to say so you're not worth my time card" lol fuck outta here
the soylent
right? what planet is this?
good night!! even though it's past my bedtime but i have to see this. 😊
he wasn't prepared for this.
i think you may need to make some friends who don't hate &amp; fear women.
not adult children. the clinton trash has always lived off of others money
i couldn't even watch the debate...just watching him for 5 minutes will make me throw up!!
over prepared is now a bad thing ?
the debate exposed trump...his body language is not so convincing
“oh right, i’m supposed to do that before the camera cuts.”
accomplished statesperson is missing even though i reloaded
*bernie rises from the dust
watch the 11 hour testimony, the video is on # youtube , if you need more information
he is a looser god help us
well you're lucky she represents you, then.
and jfk's addisson's.
i got beats
makes me that much more excited for
sorry he is a child it showed he lost
oh yeah, i meant in terms of "thank god we dodged those billets"
i won, but really i feel like america lost also ty …
great observation.
you know thoooo
yup exactly what i was thinking. it was a total "you people" moment
gimme hillary pryor over donny manziel easy
yes, i noticed that. was in the bag for hillary. this hurts his credibility.
will hilary release 30000 emails for trump tax release ?
moral of the story: &amp; are both shady as sus as fuck
they did talk about e-mails.
thank you!!!
you smaht. i can't look away. torn between "we deserve this" and ineffable sadness.
,god help any candidate if you were the mod. mad love for you. still torn bout all this. a latino small biz owner, what to do?
anonymously?
after she told trump to apologize, i wanted to scream. clinton apologize for benghazi!
i urgently need mouthwash
system is designed to take as much as possible from 99% of people.
she is painful. where was she on 9/11/12
or as he would so eloquently call it "[the] cyber" 🙄
that's a very bold statement considering all of david's political tweets are the worst thing to appear on my tl
cracking up.
bobby newport was legit stupid 😂
yaaaass! need more in my life!
no. there are too many racist mouth breathers out there who agree with every incomprehensible thing he said.
what i'm here for ✨
i like this
same. too many to pass up
why is this tweet no longer available
lies, liar, pathetic!
really? do you not know the criteria for this performance?
your article on the russian mole was stupendous. thank you for great journalism!
you're good over there : p
i can attest that he is a very nice man
oh my god, this
does trump know what a dictionary is
wait am i gonna get two minutes to respond to each one of these points? because there's a lot to unpack here.
sad but true....like to say whats the lesser of two evils??? 😈
i should have had this tonight while watching the debate lol would have helped me
and white women been the standard of what's acceptable and appropriate for centuries and everyone fine with that
but actually s/o to the hardworking editors and camera people trying to keep those letters lined up in the face of unbearable stupidity
trump talked right over and didn't answer questions posed by
yeah seems to me they saw a very disconnected candidate that sometimes sounded real alongside a stilted, but true politician.
i have a book of his lol
you'd be surprised
ha, you picking a fight with me, lil lady? what did i do? i'm just pointing out the obvious, suzy!
. i'll send you yes way hillaré! dm your address 🇺🇸🇺🇸
they asked trump about birther but no questions about hillarys emails or staff taking immunity deals and 5th amendment.
oh my god, please don't. we don't need anything else sharp near us as this election gets nuttier. just rum.
but all these guys stay playing 🙄
. because we know he will change his position in the next 10min which he did.
still, she was rude to you. don't give omarosa a platform.
it's truly madness
you will not be disappointed!
thx!! we work hard. nice 2 c it all paying off.
“you said you were smart for not paying any taxes?” “i simply did not say that.”
i was there in spirit. hope to come home soon!
yes. it did.
gotta wait for the hq pics cause this
unprepared throughout but he did stick rosie o'donnel in his nuclear weapon policy
ahem, i believe mexico is going to pay for all them from now on. try to keep up erich.
it made him look really bad
because he can't tell the difference.
tough news, but look at it this way: gives a young kid a shot. passing game needs something.
make twitter soup again
don't tease me...
exactly. no clinton foundation
the was finally mentioned on .
no stamina , lack of good experience.
i told her that. got a problem with that???
again, please stay out of american politics, it really is none of your business, globalist
everything about tonight was embarrassing
no. it was a college professor debating a 5 year old.
true! lets just all go off what you see on your twitter feed :)
seriously, please explain.
i don't agree with his political views.
he got a little salty, but reined it in. then asked for cookies because he didn't say the nasty things he was thinking.
and consumed a gallon of water
men are pigs. except the 2 of us
just called your san jose store and the manager wants me to bring back a 90 lb and 7ft long box to exchange.
let's vote stein! what could go wrong.
because she's our best option and the bible was written by men and also separation of church and state
you won't loose me, while i walk this earth. you are my babe. &amp; perfect to me. if i leave,i'll prob drop of depression...
you mind leaking her credit card number next
she's with the apprentice host.
not in a good way
away from him, then i saw his trump hat and stopped paddling away.
thank you so much! i'm nervous but excited!
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
omg this is so right, trump is master shake
she was a bully? she was a bully? he interrupted her an avg of once per minute. he called the moderator a liar.
. you're a loser. and a bad one at that.
yeah.. if only that was the case with trump :/
then she has to seal the deal.
oh, dear and you seem like such a nice young woman.
. she needs someone like you to tell her when to smile. women can't handle these things on their own, you know.
rts per minute stat is genius
indeed. but tonight was the most stark, real-time contrast between able-to-do-the-job and sociopath.
you haven't seen a real lineup yet! 1-9 is a real threat!
i didn't spell anything wrong? the donald can't even keep the things he's said straight. or form sentences
right, the people showing up in your feed.
i may have another one that you can add. not sure if it's public yet. will check this thursday.
from republican frank luntz
. as the son of a dental hygienist, and the ex-boyfriend of a dentist, her dental work is horrible.
though with all the lies and half-truths… how are any of you going to know?
i agree with more of trumps plans than hillarys, shes no treehugger either.
this is not reality television! overprepared?? to be president?? what does that even mean!
yes todd w the mike jones reference
hillary definitely had clear, concise points, whereas i just don't think donald trump had the stamina.
because you don't like the results. i campaigned with hundreds of sanders supporters. more than half are voting stein.
this is the one i meant to reply to. oops.
wowww, gotta blast. it's not safe here. i wonder who it is.
y have i never thought of doing that 🤔
save this forever
flagged badly 5min in! shouting and sniffing like a crackhead
must focus on the enemythe1 who plans to destroy🇺🇸&gt;hillary&gt;destroy her w her crimes&gt;she's theevil 1&gt;u must win✅
oh, 91? i thought it was 41. i'd go more with 50-60 won't vote for her from what i've read and personal experience.
is it any good at least?
lmaooo i would've been the same she seems like she came on too strong
in the post debate spin, he did.
trump was the one who was out of control, interrupting hillary, filibustering like crazy and not answering the questions.
so much clearer! x
just a hack. ready for cnn and nbc.
wait three days and let see ttttt
hillary's ?'s:your thoughts on the economy and race relations? trump ?'s:whers taxes and why did you support war?
that's ok, you did fine.... what is the venue for the next debate? you are gonna pull this off.... i know it... focus
choose "lesser of two evils" if you must, or vote third party, it's still better than if you were to not vote
no upgrade, but an enjoyable flight all the same! thanks.
just damn!!!!
zircon. emphasis on con.
you and me both friend. 👍👍
trump probably couldn't spell cyber security if his life depended on it.
that would be dope af!
no, you’ve spent a quarter century critiquing the gullibility and venality of the american people. now it’s their turn.
i don’t have to go to work either, but i’m an adult so i do anyway.
. you're a coward
right!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
bitch you support him shut your mouth
yes, trump does have the best temperament. just ask the people closest to each candidate.
it was pretty even. given all the presstitutes hillary won because she didn't screw up or illary-out
lol i'm so numb i didn't even bother ordering it haha
almost like josé was with him at the plate
i'm sure we'll get stats about how many more people talked about the debate vs on twitter by sheer numbers. but go look at your feed. crazy.
lmao i noticed that too 😂😂
**is better**
they know he imploded.
parody account, i noticed it late too
so much for 's cornering of
lol it aint that bad
nope. never should have been an issue of politics....even now. but i know she would have sunk him had he said.
sounds like a bot script.
i'm leaving for ct from jamaica at 5-ish if u ever need a ride 😏😏😏
undecided voter are you sure you don't mean over prepared? maybe because you are a woman you put too much weight on…
not one word on the supreme court.
i won't be sharing any details that aren't public knowledge, if i ever think of any. buffering 40 seconds internally for a 1080p stream is…
thank 5th column and the "stand-4-nothing but obama's agenda" for agreeing to a dem hack moderator
with the sound off, he looked nervous and angry. she looked calm and in control. but i don't think it'll push poll numbers:(
protect ya neck
god bless those 9%?
my hope is that those who don't understand how absurd this is. there's not even a real decision to make here. it should be 538d-0r on 11/8
wow somehow in all of this i missed that that is his name. wishful anyone??
"you've gotta be kidding me! this is fucking bullshit! i have to walk literally 3 miles" 👉🏿
one billion dollars 👆
i just read the gunslinger and didn't like it????
because it's a lost cause- go home donald trump. you're in way over your square and orange head
and let's not forget the are also banged up, too.
i don't know about fb's algorithm but yeah, they have proportionally more republicans than twitter for sure.
emails were/have been covered, 9 investigations/benghazi and that foundation? rated a+ yours? nope.
back to watching the last 30 minutes of part i: the warmup round. 🇺🇸
seriously, this guy is killin me these days
i hope nobody stole it. i can't even buy another one because i cant find tge store. its like they never existed. its hurting
as soon as he said law and order was the answer to improved race relations i almost threw my remote at tv
how you going to hate from outside the debate, when you can't even get in?
unbelievable. he essentially vomited all over and treat it like he won
there is no 1 to vote 4 so the question is who do you most want to vote against? hillary would have us overrun by jihadis.
not for a person who drives an average of 7 miles per day. (dad works from home.)
if you promise to take the other two off the stage.
danke (just practicing in case trump wins. maybe it should be russian.)
proving once again thay "the ghoul" giuliani lost his mind long ago.
that was a good statement
that is my hot take goodnight
because he is "smart" !! (his words - not mine)
zoinked collab with me
i was thinking anti-virus, since they’re all scams anyway.
yeah, already really love that feature!
…did she get brainwashed from space?
haha honestly i didn't look close enough to know!
i was just thinking that the other day. apparently they're slowly writing songs, but they're concerned about the production costs.
the man thinks he's the voice of god. nice, just in time for halloween.
not false. heres your own headline. 2800 jobs created in mexico. not here. god i fucking hate "factcheckers"
yea we moving to canadah
i can't vote, because i'm a "non resident alien". it's torturous.
have you seen what is doing with it? amazeballs.
these guys deserved a shot
trump did enough, especially while questions were about policy to win big. too bad he went with cheap shots,probably told to..
it produced the greatest receiver ever to be inexplicably greater than keyshawn johnson so that's pretty good.
close or maybe this guy...
we have a democratic republic that has colloquially been described as a democracy since the founding fathers.
the corporate ties on hillary are pretty imposing. question: who will she really work for?
amazed that you can get 90% of undecideds to agree on anything.
yeah i use tweetbot but there’s a lot of people rting
apparently paying taxes is for dumb losers
i loved it!
probably christian because you like him more than me 😒
trump punted on the obese vote.
class act. what's going on in su these days?
it wasn't deleted, it's still there
"thank you for your interest in our company. we will not be moving forward with your application at this time."
*shots fired*
that's ridiculous, you are far more accomplished and principled than me. that guy needs to fuck off
might have to hook me up with some of your friends
i believe in you.
grow up if i was simon i wold have been left you. you act like a victim all the time
thx@ my new massage bed...
it looks like my gti, which means i can sell my mother on it. very important.
i bought one for and liked it so much i bought one for myself too!
so proud that trump restrain himself from all the attacking hrc that lester holt affiliated all night. is pos
which is why he took the opportunity to tell us all about where his properties are, how great they are.
we got this unit for our bedroom and are thankful for it tonight:
pushing a progressive on that seat could set the stage for everything we want, "blank out"...risky
except for people who thought trump was unprepared, rude and incoherent. this will b reflected in the polls in the coming days.
another fact: "white only" policies shaped the first 200 years of this country. mediocrity 101. own that.
who do you think reaffirmed that he thinks it's okay to call women fat pigs?
majority watching cnn are for clinton, so poll a joke! fox poll shows trump won debate!
imma tell u now, 'momma ain't raised no bitch'
criminals clintons!
they slayed my existence 😩😩🙌🏼💦💦
agreed holt was spineless
here's the problem. you are not average.
i mean he must be a coke head
i got the second part down 🙋🏻
ford motors just tweeted that no us jobs will be lost. trump knew this and still lied about it. according to msnbc
yall have cows like on campus!! i was so ded. lmao! like why?!? my mom was like "is an aggie the name of a cow???" 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
pretty sure you mean, "from most sites that cater to people like me," but ok. what are the others?
we all go through thangs man
the map used to be front and centre. now? self promotion and features nobody uses.
yes. clinton needs to now show the millennials the difference between her policies and gary johnson's policies. will make a diff.
and he won't do a damn thing for our country. except destroy it.
this tweet is not about the debate omg how could you.
i have to get your new book. can't wait!!
why wourk u say this ong
inline 5 turbo awd?
please read this article—i was an anti-vac crackpot until this happened— + also … (1 of 2)

hyperbole will get you nowhere, 8 minutes!
so yeah, i just had to explain to bea how old stuff is really racist for no good reason.
what day are you going dude? i wanted to go, but not sure if it works out with show days
"these other realms aren't subject to empirical evidence so you just have to trust me that they exist"
lol. yeah like getting upset to the point you piss your pants.
😋thanks sarah, that is the best thing a smart person could do, "home cooking" &gt;i do it every chance i get 😜
relax it’s probably an internet poll. cnn poll tells a vastly different story.
yeah hopefully they don't push though
it's three of them i hate y'all
plse did watch debate? trump dealt with moderator interrupting him, clinton didn't.
- he allowed too many interruptions.
turns out, competence is like a clock. she's gone all the way around. she loses. modulo competence.
profiting from free labor is the american way. it's shameful &amp; disgusting.
back away from the twitter machine, howard. i think hillary's got this.

why did this happeb
james i think her exposed server caused benghazi.
2 bad they don't ask y? he was rude, incoherent, unprepared &amp; rambling but other than that yeah fine performance.
his brain, perhaps you're not aware, is very good. the best people are saying.
this tweet looks familiar 🤔
not to mention there's a brolic ass centipede that got inside
hang in there fam everything gets better in your 30s
pretty confident genuine polls by thursday will show the opposite, but i could be wrong.
3/ …which used to be considered a treat of the "african race", until it was discovered that the gene's found near malaria.
hell of a birthday present! hope you had a great one!
stop whining and take responsibility for being a public figure representing beauty and gaining so much weight. shame on you.
she is an idiot.worse than trump.
the actual winner was hilary
also did he say it in his gd closing statement? seemed over pretty soon after??
yaaaaass, it has arrived!
thanks so much!!! appreciate it!!💖💖💖😇
8/ iq tests are notoriously worthless, but racists love them because there are so many confounding variables to… overlook.

mannnnn miggy said it not me why u gotta do me hella dirty 😂
lmfaoooooooo 😭😭😭
weird. i heard his mic was broken. must have been broken in always on position. 🤔
is that the best he can do bring it he is such an idiot how about bringing some substance to the debate
you better not bitch
he was endorsed by 5000 of them. and i'm sure the other 11,000 will be voting for him too.
islam killed malcom x in 1965
unhinged and wheezing often go together . and an unquenchable thirst. and clammy little hands.
i am not sure how this could even be investigated. do you have thoughts on how this could be confirmed?
even ted cruz would be better than trump and ted cruz sucks
it might be tax deductible. 😊
the dif. between libs and leftists is the latter can acknowledge he slayed her in opening on trade. also was democratically elected
listen to if u havent🤘🏼

my stream is 2:1 trump vs hillary for sure, but not in a good way for trump.

hope you are all having a good off season! that was terrible to watch :( hope you are on the mend!!
dude i had the same great views yesterday on approach from dc, straight up the west side with great views on a clear night
yup! no regrets about missing the majority of the debate
dems issues? - birther - foul mouth - racist - taxes - all these will not help average families put food on their table.
also, she was happy.
full respect. it just crossed my mind. i don't doubt mets fans were completely understanding, &amp; much power to them.

lester holt fact-checked trump 5 times and clinton 0 times. trump said 7,870 words to her 6,181.
if trump literally admitting to being to smart to pay taxes which pays veterans and teachers is not an l bar is low
when you feel old af but you're only 18🙃🙃
it never really works for me
i told you not to leave like three times
but nooooooooo
thanks to you, i now know how to report an ad to twitter as an "illegal product or service."
trump wasn't bullying anyone. he was protecting himself in a two against one debate. was favoring hillary!
forever floored by her beauty. good lord ❤️
finally, someone i didn't already follow!
i'm also fairly certain he's never been to a 3rd world airport. also what's so great about beijing &amp; shanghai airports?

he doesn't listen. he who doesn't listen wants to be president. will he listen to "the generals?"
it's clear that has changed the participatory nature of elections in the usa. brilliant.
trump needs to prep, if he loses this against the horribly flawed hrc = bankruptcy # 7
ted, i grew up here and i have no idea either.
set up. it was obvious. question supporting the iraq war when he was not in gov't like her.
i thought shes fighting for womens equality. shes a fraud
proof of what hillary said, " lives in his own reality"
trump is so cyber it's ridiculous.
in the confines of breaking the law hillary promoted clinton foundation while being paid by american taxpayer as secretary of state
and. and nothing on your tax returns.
trump held his own, regardless
it's such a little yet very convenient thing!
what did holt bring up to help trump? no talk of immigration, syrian refugees, hils 65%estate tax etc

you're doing beautifully. remember: "small steps, practiced over time, with feedback &amp; peer support"
i have seen 4 polls guess what you lost in all big time
trump appears to be more pro life then clinton at this point. hillary agrees with abortion up to birth.
lol. thank you !
this was in response to a question on whether trump should bring up clinton marital problems in the future.
i actually had the same thought!!! &lt;3
i actually look at response time, and also at the recent commit history. if all prs are all old, i might be discouraged.
what are you a bernie bro?
you're clearly delirious bro, have a drink.

thought it was a draw no home runs either side. thought trump could have been a little tougher

after the debate i am all for you. but don't keep the hate going. that's the problem. everyone is at fault.
a matched pair.
great ?-mandated field trip by school ?
your mother is a nigger!!--right?
i'm dropping the class earlyyyy
lmao i would've taken it for the team
10:00p trump is now doubling down on his rancid racist attempt to delegitimize the first african-american president.
within 7 days i'm gonna spend about 1500$ lmao nice exactly what i wanted to do
tend to differ undecided did get impacted as showed her presidential attributes!
sold! thanks for continuing to be a leader in the space!!
go after it, don't sit an wait, chase it 💪

coffee just shot out of my nose
lester holt repeatedly cut mr trump off but not hillary. i muted hillary everytime
hillary is a lying mouthpiece
🔴must show more competence go on offensive with knowledge and control ❗️❗️🔴
corrupt is u supporting a candidate u really don't know anything about &amp; wont release his taxes
i just checked out your blog --
my trumpet's age matter, it's starting not to work.... what do i do
you've got a deal
you're also not someone who understands economics.
go here for show details--&gt;
that won twitter
no doubt and an enabler of racists. the media should stop pretending he is a viable candidate.
ha! the internet moves fast 🐸🐸
and if u are pro hrc why r u jumping on me
yes!! and that's without benghazi or the cf being brought up!

i have only seen a few episodes. looking forward to fences since it is an amazing play.
today was close. you have got to figure out how to eat healthy on the road ed.
can we please focus on making &amp; trend today instead of giving this asinine bully more attention?
are ideas that are different than yours "misconceptions" or just a different idea?
sounds like an amazing plan. have a safe and fun race.
perfectly fine? gtfoh
sounds like a book my mom would enjoy haha

you as well! always nice to see a fellow indian. xx
math is not his strong suit -
dammit donner! i said, thank you, no thank you please!
and i didn't even shout "wrong" at him! i don't really wanna be great.
and to be fair look at other retweets i did - just to be clear i'm totally indifferent on politics - think they are all lost
if you ran a ks to make a documentary about the scam of these crowdfunding social media marketing firms, they'd contact you
strange, as i have it on my kindle.
i knew this fucking puzzle that wasted four months of my life would help me one day
no!!!!! 👎 he cannot lead this country. you cant file bankruptcy donald when you 🏃 the country in the ground like your businesses
i stand corrected. triples are for grandpas(who don't ride) and people who don't know how to calculate gear ratios.
except he won. specially with independent voters.
it is. it's hard work, time, energy, sacrifice--&amp; most importantly--you learned something valuable to you!
- holt is an idiot if he believes more taxes and regulations will fix the economy. usa products will not sell on world market.
studies like peyton--didn't say he was peyton, idiot. he would know, he coached them both. classic skippy.
she's unquestionably the lead...
i will never forget your first welcome squeal &amp; hug. you leapt outa that chair like a gazelle😁 safe trip home *friendsforever*💜
this looks like the beginning of a great anal porn :)
surprise to whom exactly, except perhaps editors at the paper.
yeah i asked twitter, got like 25 replies saying tamme, but for some reason i really didnt think he was the right choice lol
he said the moderator was wrong on several occasions, when there was documented evidence of the contrary. ie climate change or s&amp;f.
neither, but the american people "lost".
fam. only on twitter.
this is the kind of devastation we are bringing on by using gunpowder climate change real. flooding, earthquakes
reminds me of trump hearing china and russia
but it's obvious you don't understand. he tried but it didn't work! trump won!
i think this is key. the indefinite form of the turkish liberal intellectual has allowed room to maneuver.
yes it does since the gov't wastes every damn penny and tax payers get nothing for it
as for intellectual sale-outs, they too could find an ample argument of why their support has remained w/erdogan.
glad i chose to wait
how stupid is that, if you have a chance to graduate when you can why wouldn't you take it lmao

well shoot!!
buwhahahahahahah same polls said romney won... yeah...
it's possible! i know some with no degree and great jobs esp in the more major cities
here... **cuddles**
it's totally true and fair. love the guy, amazing talent, but needs to channel it properly
every time i see this photo i think for a split second it's
you'd rock a turtleneck. besides, they are fantastic for hiding all those *lovebites* from your plushiettes😉😇😈
trump says it's because women on other planets are too fat and often have scales.
. easy peasy
that kind of recognition perhaps must be mutual
and i promise increasing military supremacy in a region only to get more bystanders killed likely won't help cut down on radicalization.
same to you... hope you had a smooth ride home as well!
if you beat it any worse, you'd be tennessee
only bc of trump -hillary has been giving intellectually relevant debates4long time.this was beneath her
...funny little man. truly an "invent" of his environment. quirky i must say...
travel has brought my family closer with shared, fun memories!
this is the bias i want to _try_ to be most cognizant of when i’m a parent
top 3 terrible decisions?
hillary stands for the same things, ed. they're the same evil person for the same vil standards
that was really what i was asking about
hahah love you chloe 💖💖💖💖
jesus lord. i am trusting ur word that says if we keep our mind stayed on him.
i also understand she was 'a tad bit over prepared' and smiled too much. the nerve of some candidates. smh. 🙄
we would still be drunk
me too! but it's where the magic happens.
great review! isn't the device ip68?
for a moment there thought you were doing some
nowhere. trump is a racist &amp; hillary is a beneficiary of a racist system
hmmph! members only. you need a 'mystery readers' subchapter
bigger question: why should have to "prove" his citizenship to anybody, ever?
thanks man!
i appreciate the work so much more since i started on movie a day challenge. i only make about a minute movie and appreciate
not @ all! 11:00 am is lunch time for me!
and they never will
both possibilities are equally horrific.
more on designing with quantitative data. how to write the right q's for an experiment, what a good experiment looks like
who are you sounding ridiculous on twitter
you know it's mostly people making fun of how bad you lost last night... right?
not america.
i'm not a fan of either candidate.... any intelligent american could do a little research &amp; know trumps plans are terrible.
boy but if it was venezuelan debt you better believe that'd be a push notification
hmm, i'd update to: - where i find the best donuts - where i brag about easing the best donuts

trump's a messiah. messiah's don't have to prepare to be president. just exude greatness with their aura. bow to omnipotence, fools
in that case, enjoy&amp;join
'the donald' wasted effort and words on a topic that has no significance! better served with immigration, wall, econ, etc!!
thanks and you too
is he? is he though?
interesting... still down for july. even with high number of cooling degree days. pennsylvania up y-y. that will change.
that's a compliment that i'm not him 😂
so he has started 800 companies?
who signed off on a mass email blast to all users? you can't segment? are your analytics broken? not the way to impress
y'all too brave for that
this is ongoing problem fills me w/ anger.it perpetuates centering white anxiety as electorate norm aka last nite
yea man, and even i was there for a little bit! next time....
i will be buying this very very soon
it's time for fans to take back the enjoyment
the fact that she checked him on 95% of the other bs &amp; managed to remain graceful &amp; calm is enough for round 1 👊🏼
"97%" ...... hmmm. so nyc only has 3% of the crime it had with stop and frisk? can you source that for me?
sniffling/sniffing or whatever that was
i'm sure you'll find a nice girl who finds your anger issues and degrading comments toward women charming 👌🏼
remember: . is a registered rino!! . are scared enough to fix-the-debates!
your party's candidate
i listened to cbc1 direct feed. you could really hear trump snorting. he is evil
you lost every poll except cnn poll.people are tired of your robotic fake political talk. time for real change and its trump
i think its now, today about an hour ago
but yeah, family sometimes means sucking it up and being a grown up.

have fun n be safe angel!!!!
i'm just throwing down this morning. i have an unusual need to be punched.
i'm confused on what you are talking about
yeah but since the headlines framed it as "not model behavior," i'm gad she's making this point!
i saw him on may 7th in philly july 9th in newark and july 18th at msg in new york
as long as they don't taste like refugees.
exactly why i hate this shit now like cmon now 🙄
no,and today he reminds me of dom deluise in history of the world, surrounded by fake fawning admiration. embarrassing really

its ludicrous to think that taxpayers should have to pay for this. feminism (the wrong kind) started all this
maybe have the 'pvp npc's' come out more frequently &amp; in bunches. also rewarding good chunks of percent completion.
oh richie i like your thinking.
he's high on life! 😉
doesn't matter - holt was under so much pressure from shrillary's people to correct him
trump said, "so do i" when hillary said she had a fact-checker running on her site in real time. he di…
the "never tweet" strategy is also effective
yeah it will, so do it at another gym because they're the worst
where mind at bih?
yes, thank god.
weezy's lol gdi
: has great data on the debate outcome...there find some comfort. 😉
pretty bad but it was worth it
it was great if only there wasn't so much bad mouthing people on your show. hilary is just as bad.
yeah, probably close. though j7o down may be one gut too much for me. turn that 7 into an 8...
who cares you need to make some money and kill everyone

omg, what the fuck. :)
stupid happiness mooc is actually educational, go figure. i wanted to hate it.
chronicle piece on the box city project...
hard to call out 1 issue when t is lying 4x/s. meanwhile holt let t interrupt the whole time. t had ample opp to call out tpp
cnn is so one sided for hillary! how about some balanced news coverage for once!
i thought it was just something funny to watch on late night!
i am still learning/deconstructing. which brings me to another point - listen to each other. talk to one another! dialogue is so important.
well, him and the microphone
yes she did.. i didn't enjoy that..

i wasn't insulting him. pointing out his exemplary qualities of temperment is not insulting. btw, she spoke policy.
people were engaged by his imperfection
she's not fighting for anything in that speech, she's trying to give up; rally support for someone else.
compare with trump: developed "very very good relationships with afamericans over the last little while." ??!
the msm always scrutinizes trump like he was a politician.the politician,smarmy hillary,35 yr vet,gets protected!
from familial to social media, grasping for anything. words elude him, as does his national language.
then your father is a liar too. i guess. ford released a statement already. fact.

so, your answer is to take away all the robotics and move in real people?
this is interview trump says "either attack or don't," and doesn't voice opposition. next interview w/cavuto on 2/23 say looks like success.
it usually takes a lot more for me to stop reading someone. i appreciate the insight he gives to another perspective

ralph nader didn't lose that election. the neocon dems did by alienating progressive voters away from the party.
it’s true; ask sean hannity.

i also challenged the other night and she declined out of utter fear! or we were both tired.
you’re next bowden. don’t push me—i’m older and crazier than you realize! //

you're not a good person smh
gotta keep working
let's start a business together as a lark but also let me tell you how fucked up your relationship to capitalism is.
i caught that too.
clinton still supports nation building. but of course you avoid that fact.
i hope it's a good sandwich.
trump will never be president- especially now that he criminally violated the embargo to do business w cuba in 1999.
we would start out that way. but he runs very slow
update: my friend found it at the same spot ((:
yes totally!
yeah cuz imf has been so serious about upholding human rights conditionality in egypt

i never said i was ashamed of it... i'm still a gryphon
i used to be so afraid of clowns, as a lad. they still make me a little uneasy. i blame pennywise. 😩
wouldnt be surprised if hillary has ivana stories ready. could backfire. focus on hillary:
damn that's a chow chow? they did his hair lol
is that a little bit of pussy too?
i've completely given up having political conversations because of what pops up on ye olde facebook dot come timeline.
you nailed it. great viewership on linkedin (*disclaimer) but then convo happens on twitter.

oh my god hahaha

looks like a photo of a 3d copy of melania trump. i suppose she gets a standard product that way like a mcdonald's burger.
that's the problem. i wish we could intentionally walk your 1-5 order each time out if we could
pretty sure that last line was a space balls reference!
yeah, it'd be different if he weren't writing as someone who is straight up in a position to affect change in this area
pull up whenever playoffs not for another week and some change
let's remember, hillary is running, not bill. and if hillary is going to be as loyal to us the citizens of usa, and fight for us
i'm tempted to go to the jersey show just to find the merch bus outside buy my shit &amp; dip
he raped ivanka his past wife, 3 affairs and marriages, already 3campaign heads..he has never been loyal to anyone his entire life

girl fuck that you are a queen, wear whatever shoes your heart desires👑👠
love is worth about $50 to ian so not very surprised there
trump employing a religious test, in real time, of his own rally audience should alarm everyone. i mean, this guy is telling us who he is.
yet the audience loved him. i just don't get it! if you don't vote or vote…
oh shit i never noticed
has been a dishonest politcian for…
i considered putting “self-inflicted” in the previous tweet but decided to leave it implied
no thanks watching msnbc much more interesting than you could ever be. trump and nuclear weapons. clueless
this from a toad who cheated on his first two wives &amp; wishes he could date his daughter.
tomorrow is coffee day at wawa if that will ease the hangover

deplorable! both bill&amp;hill are 2-faced, double-dealing crooks!
ada is a big reason to have elevator access to every floor today, even if it wasn't always

also, men: if you're in a group and your group all talks to one woman who's alone, that will never not be threatening
we made it to the news 🤘🏾🤘🏾
something tells me this thing about not paying the bill after staying at a trump hotel is going to gather steam.
a bit of this &amp; that . . lol
so you can comment on any topic but colin can't?he was asked a question so he answered it,just like your last segment

i never donated to a campaign but have sent lots of $ to the next president which won't be her.
bitch do u really
that's the point! you must guess and then later i reveal.
. he came back!
tell me about your mobile application
this is an excellent point.
. wasn't trump exposed for doing something else reprehensible just, like, 5 mins ago? he's a powerhouse of moral turpitude.
she makes a lot of positive tweets. what candidate is more positive than stein?
he was attacked for at least 20 things. this was one of them. go back to trying to figure that new fleshlight.
should be there the other way around though :)
it’s also listening to you.
i did 20 years nypd i could make a movie about crackheads that would make your head explode
sin is wrong/ wrong is sin. according to you rape, murder, beastiality is not wrong/sin.😡

ya watched what host does for ya in bo3.
i can never trust what the tl deems as good bc yall think empire is the pinnacle of great screenwriting.

you and donald trump are brothers in that you both overreact to things on twitter.
yanks traded everyone, rebuilt the farm, and still made a run. times definitely have changed.

not just youngsters hopefully all! the old need a change of mindset too

it sucks when you catch feelings though

granted: there was nothing noble about earlier eras of politics. the decorum of the early 20th century was built mostly upon exclusion.
yes go what a game!!!

that happened to me once haha
a fucking alien pipe!!!!
i really want to try the beyond beef crumble in something mexican. i love what they do with chicken

there's some point when you have to start asking, why is it so hard to find prominent and successful gop pols who aren't willfully ignorant?
bro that was island farms .
this is such a niche new yorker tweet i love it
but he could have said: there are many leaders who have aspects i admire, but there is none as focused on liberty as i would be.
win liao lor
by that assumption alone. awkward
i disagree. i think it's fair to criticize israel; using terms like "zionist outposts" encourages witch hunts.
pull up. someone might pull up on ya. don't go ghost. don't go thrilla on'm.
too complicated.
why should british students who are jewish have to justify what goes on in israel? that's not their country.
look at the respect for sanders. who has respect like that on the right? only reagan, and that's only surface w/libs... we've just given up.
me too! i love chad, aka billy flynn!
zak is her least favorite hg.
yeah a brick wall 😉😂😂😂
i need to rewatch that part

haha it's nasty shit 😷 tasted soo bad lol
he's looking down at the basket on his last dunk. the reverse, double pump over the head dunk was incredible.

what fascinates/scares me about donald trump is how completely detached from reality he is. so non-introspective &amp; in denial about himself.
basically, i'm not sure if this is just me being anxious and i need to get over it, or if i should talk to the professor about my concerns.😕
